# Thengai Thogayal

After coming to Amsterdam, cooking our traditional recipes has become once a week occasions. Throughout the week its some kind of variety rice or roti subji. Its only on the weekends that I am able to cook the traditional fare. Eating variety rice and rotis all through the week leaves me craving for some simple yet delicious Palakkad Chamayal. 

Thogayal is an accompaniment for rice and is usually served along with Molagootal in our house. It can be had mixed with plain steamed rice too. Many who are not very familiar with South Indian cooking may confuse between Thogayal and Chutney. Thogayal is like a chutney but is quite thick when compared to Chutney. The urad dal form an important part of any thogayal. Also many variations of thogayals see the addition of vegetables like carrots, ridge gourd, pumpkin etc. My personal preference being once with some vegetables. The addition of vegetables adds a slight sweetness to the thogayal. Together with the tamarind, red chillies and coconut it makes a yummy accompaniment.

Today's post is the basic Thengai Thogayal. Now off to the way my mom makes it:





What you’ll need

    Fresh Scraped Coconut – 1 cup
    Urad Dal – 3 tbsp
    Dried Red Chillies – 2 or 3
    Asafoetida – a small piece
    Tamarind – small piece
    Oil – 1 tsp
    Salt to taste
    Few Curry Leaves


Method

    Heat a Kadai with oil.
    Add the asafoetida piece, once it puffs up well, add the urad dal and fry on medium heat till golden.
    Also add the red chillies and fry till they turn bright.
    Add the tamarind and coconut and fry for 2 to 3 minutes on medium heat.
    Cool and grind along with salt.
    Add a tsp or two of water and grind to a coarse paste semi solid paste.
    Transfer to a bowl.
    Serve with plain rice, Molagootal or curd rice.



Note:

The consistency of thogayal is usually thick and coarse.
You can add coriander leaves, sauteed carrots or ridge gourds. I will post a version of these soon.
