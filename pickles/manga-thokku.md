#  Mangai Thokku - My Guest Post @ Good Food

Hello Friends!

This is a guest post for a lovely friend of mine, Sobha of Good Food. Sobha’s space has many healthy and innovative recipes. If you are a person who keeps a check on what you eat, then her space is just right for you- with healthy and delicious recipes.

Thank you, Sobha for inviting me to your space. I am honoured and very happy to be featured in the Chef’s Favourite Series.

Mango Thokku is one of my favourite pickles and I just can’t stop having enough of it. This pickle gets made in my kitchen all through the mango season and always leaves me craving for more.
