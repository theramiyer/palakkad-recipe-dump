#  Nellikai/Amala Chutney/Thokku/ Gooseberry Spread




Everybody knows about the goodness of gooseberries/nellikai/amla. They are rich source of Vitamin C and are known for their numerous health benefits.

Knowing and speaking of the health benefits sounds very good, but I am not a big fan of these. Neither do I like them raw nor the pickle. The only form I eat them is in the dried candied form.

But that was until I tasted this version of gooseberry chutney. Recently my aunt prepared this chutney and got it for me, not knowing that I am averse to gooseberries. I did not have the heart to not taste something which my aunt had got with so much love. I did a taste check and I loved it. Tasted yum with curd rice. It was a super hit with all the elders in the family; of course kids did not taste it as it was very spicy.

The next I had it as a spread with bread. I also had it for lunch mixed with some hot white rice and a spoon of sesame oil and it tasted just awesome. These are some of the other ways this chutney/ thokku can be had. Try this and tell me how you had it.
