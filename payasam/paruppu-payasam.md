#  Paruppu Payasam/Pradhman


On my daughter’s birthday I wanted to make a different payasam as I was bored of preparing the same payasams like Semiya payasam and Paal Payasam again and again. (Nothing to beat the taste of Paal payasam though). Since her birthday fell on an ekadasi, and as my in-laws don’t eat rice on that day, I decided to prepare paruppu payasam. This yummy blend of dals simmered in jaggery and coconut milk is again a popular Palakkad dish. The payasam turned out quite well and my little one really enjoyed her payasam and birthday.


Ingredients


    Split yellow moong dal – 3/4 cup    
    Channa Dal – 1/4 cup
    Thin Coconut Milk - 2 1/2 cup
    Thick Coconut Milk - 1 Cup  
    Jaggery – 2 cups 
    Cardamom – a few 
    Cashewnuts- 6- 7 
    Raisins – a few 
    Ghee – 1 tbsp


Method

Dry roast yellow moong dal till light brown. Keep aside. Dry roast Channa dal till light brown.
Soak Channa dal in water for about 15 mins. Pressure cook the dals separately for about 3 -4 whistles.

Heat a Kadai; dissolve the jaggery with 1/4 cup of water. Strain the jaggery water to remove impurities. Wash the vessel in which jaggery was melted and pour the strained jaggery water back in the kadai. Let it boil for 3 – 5mins. Now mash the cooked dals, moong dal should get mashed well and Channa dal should be coarsely mashed. Add this to this jaggery syrup. Add the thin coconut milk at this stage and let it boil on medium flame for about 10 mins. Remove from heat and add the thick coconut milk. Do not boil after adding thick coconut milk. Add cardamom powder. Heat a small pan with ghee. Fry the cashews and raisins and add to the payasam with the ghee.

Note: 
To extract coconut milk, you will require 1 medium sized coconut. For the thick coconut milk, grate the coconut and pulse in the mixer for 30 secs. Now squeeze out the coconut extract with your hands. For thin milk, add about 1 cup of warm water to the grated coconut and run again in the mixer. Squeeze and extract coconut milk. 
Coconut pieces fried in ghee can also be added.
