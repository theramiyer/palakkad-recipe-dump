#  Semiya Payasam/ Vermicelli Payasam



My daughter’s date of birth was last week. She completed 7 years. She was so excited about celebrating her birthday. She was eagerly counting the days left for her birthday, since August. On her birthday we had a small celebration and she was very happy and content.

Now, today is her star birthday, I had been telling her about it for the past 2 days. But every time I made a mention about it, she answered that her birthday has already gone by. By no means was she ready to accept that today is also her birthday.  She followed routine and went to school as usual without giving any extra importance to this special day of hers. Anyways, her grandparents, decided to do some pujas in her name, in the temples nearby and I decided to prepare our family favorite Payasam. She is yet to taste it :)



What you’ll need

    Vermicelli – 1 cup
    Milk – 5 cup (1 liter)
    Sugar – 1 cup
    Green Cardamom – 5
    Cashew nuts – 10
    Raisins – 15
    Ghee/Clarified Butter – 2 tsp


Method

    Dry roast the vermicelli in a Kadai till it starts browning slightly.
    Add about 2 cups of water to this vermicelli and let it boil until almost done.
    Remove from heat. Strain immediately through a colander and pour some cold water over it. Set aside.
    In a heavy bottomed vessel, boil the milk and let it simmer on low flame for about 5 to 7 minutes. Stir once in a while to avoid burning.
    Add the vermicelli and boil for another 5 minutes on medium flame.
    Add sugar, stir well and simmer for about 7 to 8 minutes.
    Remove from heat.
    Heat a small frying pan with ghee and fry the cashewnuts and raisins. Add it to the prepared Payasam.
    Crush the green cardamom coarsely and add it to the Payasam.





Delicious Payasam is ready. Serve warm or cold.
