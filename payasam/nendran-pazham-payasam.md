#  Nendram Pazham Payasam/ Nendram Pazham in Coconut Milk

I had a great vacation and am back in Hyderabad settling down slowly into my routine work. When I was in Bangalore, my mother had bought these delicious looking Nendram Pazhams, they are my favorite – and I don’t see them here in Hyderabad. So during my stay there I ate them to my heart’s content.

This fruit is so versatile, it can be used in a spicy gravy, as a snack as a dessert or just eat it as such. Today’s recipe is a very special one. I tasted this first time in my best friend’s house. From the first spoonful, I knew that I was going to make this very soon. And so I got the recipe from her and made it within 2 days. This happened about 8 years back and this dessert has become an integral part of our family. Actually, neither she nor her mom knew the name for this. So I just decided to give it my own name. So here is the recipe:


What you’ll need

1. Nendram Pazham – 3 (Medium Ripe)
2. Powdered Jaggery – 1 cup
3. Coconut Milk – 200 ml (I used store bought packet)
4. Cardamom – 3
5. Ghee – 1 tsp

Method

Remove skin and chop the bananas into quarters. Heat a Kadai, add the banana pieces. Add water, so that the banana pieces get just submerged in water. Also add about ½ the packet of coconut milk. Stir well cover and let it cook for about 5 to 7 minutes or till the banana pieces are done.
In the meanwhile, dissolve the jaggery in very little water strain for any impurities and keep it aside. Once the banana pieces are cooked add the dissolved jaggery syrup to it and let it boil for another 5 minutes. Turn off heat and add the remaining coconut milk. Sprinkle cardamom powder and drizzle 1 tsp of ghee for flavor. Nendram Pazham Payasam is ready. Tastes best when served warm.


Note:

Adjust amount of Jaggery according to your taste.
