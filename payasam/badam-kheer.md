#  Badam Kheer/Almond Milk




Yesterday, my blog baby turned 2. It would never have been possible without the support of my family, friends, virtual friends, readers and silent readers. I remember how I started this blog without even knowing what actually blogging is. I had no idea how to present food and take good pictures. I did not know anything about lighting, backgrounds etc. I have actually taken photographs in the night, with the only light source being a single tube light, and posted them as well. I was always excited about blogging. The day I post a recipe, I keep checking my mail a dozen times in a day to see how many comments my post has received. It continues even today, after two years. That excitement to cook, click and post is still the same. And I hope it just continues this way. I thank all the people who stop by this little space of mine and keep it ticking!


Serves - 4
What you’ll need

    Almonds – ¾ cup
    Milk – 3 ½ cup
    Sugar – ¾ cup
    Saffron 6 to 7 strands


Method

    Take the almonds in a vessel. Add water to immerse them well.
    Heat this till the water starts boiling. Remove and set aside.
    Cool completely and remove the skin of the almonds
    Grind the almonds with about ¼ to ½ cup of water into a smooth paste.
    Boil the milk in a vessel. Once it starts boiling, let it keep simmering. Stir once in awhile to avoid burning.
    Take a ladle full of warm milk and soak the saffron strands in it.
    Simultaneously, heat a Kadai, add the ground almonds paste, add about a tbsp or 2 of water mix well and stir well on medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes. Keep stirring else the almond paste may get burnt.
    Now add the boiled milk and stir well without any lumps. Cook on low to medium flame stirring once in a while.
    Once the mixture starts boiling, reduce heat to low and add the sugar mix well.
    Simmer for another 5 minutes. Stir once in a while.
    Finally add the saffron milk and mix. Remove from heat.


Serve warm or chilled.



Note:
You can soak a few extra almonds and use them to garnish the kheer by chopping them and adding it add the end.
You could also add some cardamom powder, but personally like only the taste of almonds and the fragrance of saffron.
You can add a pinch of yellow food color.
