#  Nendram Pazham Nurukku



Thinking of some of the Kerala specialities like Nendram pazham, Chakka (Jackfruit), Koorka etc brings back memories of my grandfather. My grandfather was a typical Palakkad Iyer who loved naadan food. My father was in a transferable job, and so we have had to live in different parts of the country. Where ever we lived, every year, my grandfather would visit Puthucode (our native place), during the Navarathri festival. He would stay there enjoy the sadhyas, panchavadyams and be absorbed in the festivities.

On his return journey, he would purchase all the Kerala special goodies, which in those days were difficult to find in other parts of the country. I and my brother would eagerly await his arrival. He would go with one bag and come back with a minimum of 3 to 4 bags. The famous Kaya Chips, Koorka, Nendram Pazham, Nendram Kaya would be there for sure. He would even get the Kaya tholi (Nendram Banana peels) to make thoran.  He didn’t stop at that. Once home, he would carefully hang the bananas on a hook and allow them to ripen, and would decide the menu for the coming few days.

Ok, now coming back to the present, today’s post, Pazha Nurukku is an essential part of the onam sadhya in the central parts of Kerala. It is also served as part of breakfast in most Kerala homes.
