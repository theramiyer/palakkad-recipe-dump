#  Broken Wheat Rava Pongal




We’re into the 7th edition of Magic Mingle. This is one event which I look forward to every month. The secret ingredients which Kalyani announces at her space on the 5th of every month always pose an interesting challenge. The 2 magic ingredients for this month are Split Yellow Moong Dal and Black Pepper. The first thing that would come to most people’s minds would be Ven Pongal. For me, Yellow Moong is synonymous with Molagooshyam. But I have posted both the recipes so decided to try a variation of the regular Pongal.

Broken wheat rava upma makes a regular appearance in my kitchen since a long time, but a pongal made out of the same is the latest addition to my menu of regulars. It’s definitely a healthy and tasty alternate to the traditional ven pongal which is prepared out of rice. Traditionally, pongal is made for breakfast, but we like to have it for dinner. You could also serve it to kids, when they come back from school. Best served with coconut chutney, sambar or gothsu.
