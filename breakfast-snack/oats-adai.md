#  Oats Adai

Adai is one of our family favorite tiffins. So I make it regularly. I have tried a couple of variations with the regular adai, like this Barley Adai. I also make adai with Broken wheat or Godhumai Ravai. I will post that variation also soon. This time I tried to replace some of the rice in the Adai with Oats. There was no difference in taste. I added a little rice, so as to get a little crispy adais, but you can replace the rice completely if you wish to. Feel free to add chopped onions, or chopped spinach. I just decided to go plain.




What you’ll need

    Oats – 1.5 cup
    Rice – ½ cup
    Toor Dal/Thuvaram Paruppu – ½ cup
    Channa Dal/Kadala Paruppu – ½ cup
    Dried Red Chillies – 2 or 3
    Asafoetida – ¼ tsp
    Curry Leaves – few
    Salt to taste


Method

    Soak the Rice and dals along with red chillies for 3 hours. Soak the Oats for one hour.
    Drain the water and grind the rice, dals, oats and chillies into a coarse paste, just like for regular adai.
    The batter should not be too runny so don’t add too much water.
    Add salt to taste and mix well. Allow to rest for about a hour.
    Before making the adai, add roughly chopped curry leaves and asafoetida powder and mix well. Adjust the consistency of batter by adding water if required.
    Heat a tava. Pour a ladle of batter on to the hot tava and spread like a dosa from inside out. Drizzle oil on all sides.
    Let it cook on medium heat, flip and cook on the other side, drizzle a tsp of oil. Cook until the adai turns light brown.
    Remove from tava and serve hot with an accompaniment of your choice.


Note:

    You can add finely chopped onions or finely chopped spinach.
    You can replace the red chillies with ginger and green chillies.
    You can grind the adai batter and make adais immediately, but I like to rest my batter for a couple of hours.
