#  Ammini Kozhukattai/ Mini Steamed Rice Balls

Ammini Kozhukattais - These Kozhukattais are generally made with the leftover dough after making Poornam Kozhukattai and Uppu Kozhukattai. Poornam Kozhukattai and Uppu Kozhukattai are generally made on the occasion of Ganesh Chathurthi. My MIL makes it more frequently; I should say almost monthly, i.e on every Sankatahara Chathurthi. And everytime, she purposely makes a little extra of the outer dough so that these lovely Ammini Kozhukattais can be made.
Ammini Kozhukattais are savory mini rice balls, steamed and tempered with mild spices. This is an excellent snack for children. My daughter loves making and eating these mini savory balls. Here is the recipe for Ammini Kozhukattai:


What you’ll need

1. Rice Flour – 1 cup
2. Water – 2 cups
3. Salt – a pinch
4. Sesame Oil – 1 tsp

For the tempering

1. Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp
2. Urad Dal – ½ tsp
3. Dry Red chillies – 1 or 2
4. Asfoetida/Hing – a pinch
5. Curry Leaves a few
6. Coconut oil – 1 tsp


Method

Heat a non stick Kadai, add the 2 cups of water and bring it to boil. Add a pinch of salt and about 1 tsp of sesame oil to this water. Once the water starts boiling add the flour little by little and mix well without forming lumps until it comes together as a mass. Cover and rest it for about 5 to 10 mins. Then, apply some oil to your hands and knead into smooth dough.
Pinch out a small amount of dough and shape it into a small ball. Repeat procedure with the entire dough.
Now place these in a steamer and steam cook for about 5 to 7 minutes. The balls will be shiny when done.
For the tempering, Heat a Kadai with a tsp of oil. Temper with mustard, urad dal and red chillies. Finally add a pinch of asfoetida and curry leaves. Then add the steamed rice balls and mix well. Remove it on to a serving plate. Yummy ammini kozhukattais are ready.
