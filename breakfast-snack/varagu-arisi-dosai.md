#  Varagu Arisi Dosai/Kodo Millet Dosai - Easy Millet Recipes

My experiments with millets continues. This time I tried Dosai using Varagu Arisi also called Kodo Millet in English. I have used the same proportions as for the regular idly/dosa. The Dosas turned out very crisp and delicious. The taste is similar to the regular rice dosas. You will not miss the taste of the regular dosa. I used my mixie to grind the batter as it was a small quantity. Use your wet grinder if grinding in larger quantities. You can also make idlis with the same batter. The idlis also turned out very soft.
If you are looking to replace rice in your diet, millets are a great option. They have numerous health benefits. Do try this healthy dosai.
