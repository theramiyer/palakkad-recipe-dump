#  Oats Dosa



In my earlier posts I have mentioned quite a few times, that our family is not the kind that sits down for a formal breakfast of idly and dosa everyday. Our breakfast is oats porridge on most of the days. It is on days when I feel that the lunch may get delayed that I prepare a proper breakfast and that happens very rarely. But that doesn’t mean that we don’t have any of the breakfast items. It’s just that we don’t have it at breakfast time rather at dinner time. Now that makes it really difficult for me to click pictures of all these dosa and upma recipes which I prepare for dinner. So there are many recipes which I prepare on a day to day basis and these have not appeared on my blog yet.

The other day, when I decided to prepare these Oats Dosas, I prepared the batter in the afternoon itself and made dosas for my daughter, so that she could have them when she came back from school and I would get a chance to click pictures as well. The batter stays fresh for about 2 to 3 days when refrigerated.

So here is the recipe for a healthy dosa with the goodness of oats.



Makes – approx 16 dosas
What  you’ll need

    Oats – 1 cup
    Rice Flour – 3 cups
    Curd (slightly sour) – about 1 cup
    Salt to taste
    Cumin seeds – 1 tsp
    Green chillies – 1, finely chopped
    Ginger – a small piece, grated
    Coriander Leaves – 1 tbsp, finely chopped


For tempering

    Oil – 1 tsp
    Mustard seeds – ½ tsp
    Asafoetida – 1 pinch


Method

    Beat the curds well and soak the oats in it for about 30 minutes.
    Grind this into a paste.
    Transfer into a bowl, add the rice flour and mix well.
    Now add enough water and whisk well without forming lumps to a watery batter. (Just like you do for Rava Dosa)
    Add green chillies, grated ginger, chopped coriander and salt to taste.
    Rub the cumin seeds between your palms a few times and add that also.
    Now heat a small frying pan with oil, temper with mustard seeds and asafetida. Mix well.
    Heat a tawa well, reduce the flame, take a ladle full of batter and pour the batter in a circular motion from the outer to the inner of the tawa. Just like you do for raw dosa.
    Drizzle a little oil. Cook on medium flame till the edges start browning. Flip over and cook for another 2 minutes.
    Remove from tawa. Repeat with remaining batter.






Serve hot with a chutney of your choice. Tastes good with onion chutney.

Note:

    Use good quality rice flour else you may not get crisp dosas. If you don’t have rice flour, you can soak rice for about 2 to 3 hours and grind to a smooth paste and use it instead of rice flour.
    Make sure the batter is watery else you may not get thin dosas.
    Also make sure that the tava is really hot while pouring the batter, reduce flame while pouring and then cook on medium flame.
