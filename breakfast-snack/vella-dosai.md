#  Vella Dosai

Dosa is a well liked South Indian tiffin item. It has gained popularity all over the world. People experiment with the batter and filling and many many different kinds of dosas are seen today. Like Plain Dosa, Paper Dosa, Masala Dosa, Ghee Dosa, Rava Dosa etc etc. Of these Vella Dosai is one; though these have been made from time immemorial. This dosa is generally not available in restaurants.

Vella Dosai is yet another of my favorites. At my home mom used to prepare it very regularly though after marriage these have become really rare, thanks to their aversion to sweets. These sweet dosas are usually made on certain days of fasting like Sivarathri, Ekadasi, Shasti etc since they are made out of wheat flour. On the days of fasting, people generally avoid rice and items made out of rice. But it is not necessary that it has to be a day of fast to make these yummy sweet dosas. Generally, an uppu dosai (salt dosai – exact translation) is also made along with it. I’ll leave that for later.


Ingredients

1. Wheat Flour – 1 cup
2. Powdered Jaggery – ¾ cup to 1 cup (according to your taste)
3. Cardamom powder – ¼ tsp
4. Ghee for frying

Method

In a vessel, take about ½ a cup of water and add the powdered jaggery. Heat it till the jaggery dissolves completely. Strain to remove impurities. Now add this to the wheat flour and mix well without forming lumps. Add sufficient water and mix into a smooth Dosa batter. Add the Cardamom powder and mix well.
Now heat a tawa, pour a ladle full of batter and spread like regular dosai. Drizzle ½ tsp of ghee and let it cook. Flip over and cook on the other side also. Cook on low heat only as Jaggery can easily burn. Serve with a blob of homemade butter or a spoonful of ghee.
