#  Arisi Upma / Rice Rava Upma

Upma is a popular breakfast item in South India. It is generally made of Rava or Sooji with a combination of vegetables and generous amounts of Ghee. Other variations prepared with Semiya/ Vermicilli, Cracked Wheat, Rice Rava, Rice Flakes/ Aval and now Oats are also very common. Even though it is very popular, and people would gladly have it in hotels, somehow, when made at home, it is not very well accepted.

When I decide to make upma mostly for dinner, (since we generally don’t have breakfast), my husband will invariably ask me “Oh! Upma va!!” Followed by statements like, “You keep watching so many cookery shows, and always keep noting down recipes. Is it only to make this Upma?” In return I would say something and it would go on. In the end, most of the times he will win the battle and I will end up making something else.

But, now with my older one also at home, there’s hardly any time to enter the kitchen. Most of my time goes by in sorting out sibling rivalries. And moreover hubby dear is not in town, so it is upma in all forms and shapes on most nights. It is really simple to make and gets ready in no time. A boon when you’re pressed for time and thankfully my elder one likes any kind of upma.

So while, going through Divya’s space, my partner for this week’s blog hop, I saw different kinds of upma recipes. I decided to make Arisi Upma. I have pretty much followed her recipe but for a few changes and also I used the pressure cooker to cook, as the upma gets ready real quick in the cooker.
