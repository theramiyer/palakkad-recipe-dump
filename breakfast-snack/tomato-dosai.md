#  Tomato Dosai

Dosas are one of my favorite breakfast and dinner items. In fact, once the idly/dosa batter is ground; it would be idly on the first day and then dosai on the following days, until we’re done with the batter. It is only on days when we don’t have the idly/dosai batter at hand that I have to look for some other dish for dinner.

Tomato dosai is a nice variation to the regular dosai. I came to know about these from my SIL who is from Trivandrum. Her mother has many interesting recipes up her sleeve. My kids were thrilled to see pink dosas, (pink being my daughter’s favorite color) and gladly had a couple of them without any fuss.

So if you run out of your regular dosa batter, give this one a try.

Makes about – 15 to 16 dosais
What you’ll need

    Raw Rice – 2 Cups
    Urad Dal – 2 tbsp
    Fenugreek Seeds – 1 tsp
    Tomatoes – 5 Medium sized
    Dried Red Chillies – 1 or 2
    Asafoetida – a generous pinch
    Curry Leaves – finely chopped (optional)

Method

    Soak the rice, dal and fenugreek seeds and red chilly for 3 to 4 hours.
    Drain and grind into a smooth paste adding water as and when required. Do not add too much water as the tomatoes also will add to the liquid.
    Grind the tomatoes separately and mix along with the ground rice.
    Add asafoetida and salt to taste.  Also add the finely chopped curry leaves. Mix well. Add water if required and adjust batter into a pouring consistency. If the batter is thick you will not get thin dosas.
    Heat a Tawa/Dosa Pan, pour a ladle full of batter and spread like spreading a dosai, from center to outside. Drizzle little oil on the sides of the dosai. Cook on medium heat.
    Flip and cook the other side as well.
    Serve immediately with chutney, sambar or milagai podi.




Note:
Dosa becomes slightly hard on cooling, so for best taste, serve hot.
