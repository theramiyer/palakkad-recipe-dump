#  Godhuma Ravai Upma/Broken Wheat Rava Upma

Upma is one of the most common breakfast recipes in south India. There are many different variations to this humble breakfast. Upma is usually made of Sooji/Semonila. It can also be prepared using broken wheat, rice rava or rice flakes (Aval).

Like I have said in many of earlier posts, we hardly have elaborate breakfasts, but rather prepare all these breakfast recipes for dinner. And upma surely is one of the last resorts. It is made only when I don’t have any idly/dosa batter and I am feeling too tired to make rotis.

Today I am sharing the recipe for broken wheat upma. Usually, MIL makes this without adding any vegetables.  (See notes). But like to make it a little healthier by adding whatever veggies I have at hand. So here is the recipe for a simple yet wholesome meal.



What you’ll need

    Broken Wheat/Godhuma Ravai- 1 cup
    Onion – 1, finely chopped
    Carrot – 1 finely chopped
    Beans – 5 to 6, finely chopped
    Green Peas – 2 handful
    Green chilly – 1 or 2, chopped finely
    Ginger – a small piece, grated
    Curry leaves – few
    Lemon juice – 1 or 2 tsp (Optional)
    Coriander Leaves – 1 tbsp, finely chopped
    Salt to taste
    Oil – 2 tsp
    Ghee – 1 tsp
    Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp
    Bengal gram dal/ Kadala paruppu – 1 tsp


Method

    Heat a pressure cooker/pan with oil and ghee.
    Temper with mustard seeds and Bengal gram dal, once the dal turn golden, add the chopped onions, green chilly, ginger and curry leaves.
    Saute until onion turn pink.
    Next add the veggies – carrots, and beans and sauté for another minute.
    Now add the broken wheat and fry for 3 to 4 minutes on medium heat.
    Add 2.5 cups of water, salt and green peas. Mix well and bring to boil.
    Cover and cook for one whistle.
    Once the cooker has cooled, open and drizzle the lemon juice.
    Garnish with coriander leaves.
    Serve hot with a chutney or Sambar.




Note:
You can omit the onions and vegetables and just temper with ginger and green chillies and add freshly scraped coconut while the water is boiling and proceed as above.
