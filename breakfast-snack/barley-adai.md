#  Barley Adai

You must be wondering why I don’t post breakfast/tiffin recipes regularly on my space. It is not that I don’t prepare tiffin, just that they are prepared mostly at dinner time and not for breakfast, which makes it really difficult to click pictures. Moreover, I’m really not good at clicking pictures of these Dosai/Adai varieties. So even if I make them at some time when there’s enough light to click, I keep postponing the task of taking pictures of these items.

The other day, I tried these Barley adais for dinner and they tasted really good not to forget the goodness of barley. Also they were not as heavy as the ones made with the combination of rice and lentils. So couldn't resist clicking. I had some batter leftover, so prepared them the following day morning and took pics. As expected, pics were not up to my expectation, but still I decided to post. Do try these healthy barley adais some time; I am sure you will not miss the rice adais. 




What you’ll need

    Barley Flour – 3 Cup
    Raw Rice – ½ cup
    Tuar Dal – ½ cup
    Bengal Gram Dal – ½ cup
    Urad Dal – 2 tbsp
    Horsegram – ¼ cup (optional)
    Dried Red Chillies – 3 to 4
    Asafoetida – a generous pinch
    Curry Leaves – few sprigs
    Salt to taste
    Oil – as required


Method

    Soak the rice, dals and red chillies for 3 to 4 hours.
    Grind to a coarse paste adding water. Add the barley flour to the ground paste and mix well.
    Add the salt, asafetida and curry leaves and mix well.
    Add water as required to make the batter of pouring consistency.
    Heat a tava. Now pour a ladle of batter on the tava and spread in a circular motion from center to outside. Just like making a regular dosa.
    Drizzle oil on all sides and cook on medium flame. Flip and cook the other side too until brown spots appear and adai is crisp.
    Remove from heat and serve immediately with chutney of your choice.

We had it with Maanga Kootan.



Note:

    The adai batter does not require fermentation and can be prepared immediately after grinding. But I like to rest my batter for a couple of hours.
    You can replace the barley flour with barley pearls. Soak the barley pearls for a minimum of 5 to 6 hours.
    You can add Moong dal/pasi paruppu instead of horse gram.
    You can add finely chopped onions to the batter.
    You can replace dried red chilies with cumin and black pepper, that gives a unique flavor.
