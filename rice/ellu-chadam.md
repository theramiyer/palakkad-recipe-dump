#  Ellu Saadam / Sesame Rice




My younger one loves any kind of mixed rice. I prepare some kind of rice for my elder one’s lunch box. I always make a little extra as my younger one prefers to have this rice as her breakfast. She is not the idly, dosa kid. Every day morning after waking up, her very first demand will be to switch on the television and watch Chota Bheem and next she will ask for her bowl of rice. If by chance on some day I prepare anything other than rice for my elder one, then it becomes very difficult for the younger one to finish her breakfast. She has been following this routine since when she was 1 and half years old.

This Ellu Saadam is one such rice, which both my kids love.  Variety rice like Lemon Rice, Tamarind Rice and this Sesame rice are also offered as neivedyam. So here’s my way of making it.

What you’ll need

    Rice – 1 cup
    White Sesame Seeds – 2 heaped tbsp
    Urad Dal – 1 tsp
    Dried Red Chillies – 1 or 2
    Scraped fresh coconut – 1 to 2 tbsp (optional)


For tempering

    Oil – 1 tbsp
    Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp
    Peanuts – 2 tbsp
    Curry Leaves – few sprigs


Method

    Cook the rice. Spread on a wide plate and separate the grains with a fork. Allow to cool.
    Heat a pan, dry roast the sesame seeds in low flame till light brown in color.
    Heat ½ tsp of oil and urad dal and red chillies.
    Powder the sesame seeds. While grinding, do not run mixer for a long time. Give short pulses.
    Powder fried urad dal and chillies. Keep aside.
    Heat rest of the oil in a kadai, add mustard seeds and peanuts. Fry till peanuts are roasted. Then add the curry leaves.
    If adding coconut, add now and fry for 2 to 3 minutes.
    Add cooked rice, the powders and salt to taste. Mix well.




Serve hot with some papads.
Note:

    Adding coconut is completely optional. You can skip it if you do not like.
