# Thengai Sadam/Coconut Rice

Variety rice are always a welcome change from the regular Kootans/Kuzhambus. And they are life saviour on busy week days. Moreover, kids have a special affinity to these kind of rice varieties and hence it finds its way into the kids lunch boxes very often.

Growing up, I don't remember my mother or grandmother preparing the rice varieites too often. They were restricted to special days like Kanu Pongal - the day after Pongal or on the day of Aadi Perukku. Apart from these days, we would have either lemon rice or puliyumchadam packed for our train journeys.

All said and done, they are hasslefree to prepare and pack and are definitely a treat to the taste buds. The coconut rice is one such and is a breeze to prepare if you have some scraped coconut at hand. This is one of my personal favorites. I just love the heady aroma of the coconut and the coconut oil.

    Cooked Rice – 3 cup
    Fresh Scraped Coconut – 1.5 cup, tightly packed
    Green Chilly – 1 or 2 (adjust according to taste)
