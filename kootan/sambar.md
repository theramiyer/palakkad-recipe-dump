# Sambar

Hello Everybody,

                         Today I would like to share the recipe of Palakkad Style Sambar. Sambar is made on daily basis in any Tamil household. Sambar is usually made with Sambar Powder. The Palakkad Sambar is made with freshly ground spices and coconut and hence makes its taste unique. You can make use of vegetables like Pumpkin, Ash Gourd, Lady’s Finger, Brinjal and Drumstick. All the above vegetables can either be used in combination or you can prepare it with any one of the above vegetables.

Ingredients
