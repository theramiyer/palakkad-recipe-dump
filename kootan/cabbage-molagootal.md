#  Cabbage Molagootal

Molagootal is a popular Palakkad Iyer dish. It is basically vegetables and lentils simmered with ground coconut. Molagootals can be prepared using different vegetables. The most common ones being Ashgourd and Yam, or Keerai (Spinach). Molagootal is more like a kootu but a little more runnier. It is is well liked by kids as it is not spicy. Molagootal is one of my favorite kootans and I can have it with just some pickle. Usually it is served with either Pachadi or thogayal.



What you'll need

    Cabbage – 4 Cups, finely chopped
    Pasi Paruppu/Split Yellow Moong Dal – ¼ cup
    Scraped Coconut – ½ cup
    Broken Urad Dal – 1 tsp
    Dry Red Chilly – 1
    Cumin Seeds – 1 tsp
    Turmeric Powder – ¼ tsp
    Salt to taste


For Tempering

    Coconut oil/Any Refined Oil – 1 tsp
    Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp

Method

    Pressure cook the dal, mash lightly and keep aside.
    Cook the chopped cabbage, with salt and turmeric powder and about 2 cup of water.
    Heat a small frying pan with little oil, roast the urad dal and red chillies until the dal turns red. Take care not to burn the dal.
    Grind the coconut, fried urad dal, red chilly and cumin seeds into a smooth paste by adding little water.
    Add the cooked dal to the cooked cabbage and mix well. Let this come to a boil.
    Now add the ground coconut paste, mix well. Add about a cup of water to adjust the consistency.
    Check for seasoning and let it start boiling.
    Remove from heat.
    Heat a frying pan with oil, temper with mustard seeds and curry leaves. Pour this tempering over the Molagootal.
