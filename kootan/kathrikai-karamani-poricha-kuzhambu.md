#  Kathrikai Karamani Poricha Kuzhambu/Porichozhambu


Poricha Kuzhambu or Porichazhambu as we call it at home, is a very flavorful gravy. It is similar to the sambar, but the spices used are slightly different. The black pepper used in the ground spices, gives a very lovely flavour. My grandmother makes one of the tastiest porichazhambus. She usually makes it with either only Brinjal and Karamani or with mixed vegetables and karamani. Vegetables like, yam, raw banana, carrots, peas, ash gourd etc can be used. My Mother in law makes a version with only yam and Karamani. That tastes good too.
There are few versions of Porichazhambu, one with karamani, another leaving out karamani and using tuar dal instead and another one which does not use coconut. 
Today I am sharing the recipe with karamani/red chori beans. It is usually served with plain rice and Paruppu Thogayal.
