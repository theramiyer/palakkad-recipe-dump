#  Kathirikai Rasavangi



Rasavangi, is a close cousin of the arachuvitta sambar. The difference is in the ground spices. A few changes in the spices used for grinding and the whole thing tastes very different. My family prefers rasavangi to Sambar on any day. It has a very distinct flavor of Coriander Seeds and Black Pepper. A perfect accompaniment with white rice and a simple potato roast.

The recipe shared here is the way my grandmother and then my mother and now me have been making it for all these years. Though I see a lot of variations of this recipe, I have stuck to my original family recipe. 



Serves – 3 to 4

What you’ll need

    Brinjal – 1.5 cup, chopped into small cubes
    Tamarind – gooseberry sized
    Tuar Dal – 2 tbsp, heaped
    Turmeric Powder – ¼ tsp
    Jaggery – 1 tsp, powdered
    Salt to taste


To roast and grind

    Bengal Gram Dal/ Kadala Paruppu – ½ tbsp
    Coriander Seeds – 1 tbsp
    Dried Red Chillies – 2
    Black Peppercorns – 15 to 20
    Fresh scraped coconut – ½ cup


For tempering

    Oil – 1 tbsp
    Mustard Seeds – 1 tsp
    Curry Leaves – few torn


Method

    Wash the tuar dal and cook it. Cool and mash. Keep aside.
    Soak the tamarind in 1 cup of hot water for 10 minutes.
    Add another cup of water and squeeze out a thin tamarind extract.
    Heat a Kadai, with a tsp of oil, fry all the ingredients mentioned under “roast and grind” till the coconut turns brown.
    Grind it along with coconut into a smooth paste adding about ¼ cup of water.
    In the same Kadai, fry the brinjals for 3 to 4 minutes.
    Next add the tamarind extract, turmeric powder, jaggery and salt to taste.
    Let this boil on medium flame till the brinjals are cooked and the raw smell of the tamarind disappears.
    Now add the cooked and mashed dals. Mix well and let it come to a boil.
    Then add the ground coconut paste, mix well and let it simmer for 4 to 5 minutes.
    Heat a small  frying pan with remaining oil. Add the mustard seeds once they crackle, pour it over the prepared rasavangi.




Garnish with curry leaves.
Serve hot with plain rice and any vegetable stir fry of your choice.
