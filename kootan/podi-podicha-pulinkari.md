#  Podi Podicha Pulinkari




The Palakkad cuisine is loaded with coconut and lentils. You will hardly find any recipes without the use of these two ingredients. One such rarity is this Pulinkari. It is a tamarind based gravy with veggies like Pumpkin or ladies finger and is spiced and thickened using a special roasted rice powder. It looks very much like Sambar, but has a very distinct aroma and taste. Since the pulinkari is devoid of coconut and lentils, it is best served with usili or thoran and white rice. It can also be served as an accompaniment to idly and dosa as well.

We had with Kothavarangai Usili and rice.

Note: Pulinkari is thinner than the Sambar. Also it thicken a little on cooling, due to the addition of rice, if you feel it is too thick you can add a little warm water and mix.
