# Vendakkai Uppadan

Happy Republic Day!

For those who are wondering what happened to me…….got a little busy with my daughter’s birthday celebrations. She turned one on 19th January. We had her ayushomam function at home. So, with a house full of relatives, last minute shopping etc etc...you know how it is.
Hoping to blog more regularly in future.

Here’s today’s recipe –

One of my favorite dishes. Very easy to make. This is one of the traditional Palakkad recipes. The highlight of this dish is that it does not require any dal or coconut. Can you beat that – A Kerala dish without coconut…The main ingredient of this recipe is a spice powder.
So here comes the recipe-




Ingredients

1.       Lady’s Finger – 10 nos. Cut into 1 inch size pieces
2.       Tamarind – a gooseberry size
3.       Raw Rice – a fistful
4.       Methi seeds – ¼ tsp
5.       Dried Red Chillies – 2 - 3 nos. (or according to taste)
6.       Asfoetida – a pinch
7.       Turmeric Powder – a pinch
8.       Jaggery a little
9.       Salt to taste

For the seasoning

1.       Cooking oil – 2 tsps
2.       Mustard Seeds – 1 tsp
3.       Curry leaves – a few
4.       Coriander leaves – a few

Method

Soak tamarind in hot water for about 5 to 10 mins. Squeeze and extract the pulp.
Heat a kadai with a tsp of oil. Add the lady’s finger and fry for a few mins. This ensures that the Ladys’ finger pieces remain intact and don’t become very mushy while being cooked in the tamarind extract.
Pour the tamarind extract to this. Pour about 2.5 cups of water. Add a pinch of turmeric, asafoetida, jaggery and salt to taste. Allow this to boil till the raw smell of tamarind gone and the vegetable is done.
In the meantime, wash and drain the rice. Heat a small pan, dry roast the rice (fry without oil) after the rice is half done add the methi seeds and chillies. Fry till rice turns brownish and good aroma of methi seeds emanates. Cool and grind to a fine powder.
Dissolve this powder in about 1/2 cup of water. And add to the tamarind lady’s finger concoction. This powder gives the necessary spice and acts as a thickening agent. Adjust salt and check consistency.
Season with mustard seeds, curry leaves and coriander leaves. Serve with steaming hot white rice and some papads.



Note: This Kootan is usually a little watery. It is not as thick as Sambar. You can prepare Uppadan with Yellow Pumpkin also.
