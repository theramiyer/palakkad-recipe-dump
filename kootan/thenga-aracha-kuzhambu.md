#  Thenga Aracha Kuzhambu




It’s time for this month’s magic mingle. The magic ingredients for the month are coconut and fenugreek seeds. When I saw the ingredients, I had no doubt of what I’ll be making. It had to be this Thenga Aracha Kuzhambu literally translates into Ground Coconut Gravy

This is a typical, Trivandrum side kuzhambu, which I learnt from my SIL who hails from the land of Lord Padmanabha. It is a very flavorful kuzhambu with the lovely aroma of fenugreek seeds. A great alternative if you are bored of your regular Sambar. Tastes great with plain white rice and any vegetable stir fry or thoran.



Serves 3 to 4

What you’ll need

    Drumstick – 1, cut into finger sized pieces
    Pumpkin – 100 gms, cut into big cubes
    Tamarind – A gooseberry size ball
    Turmeric Powder – ¼ tsp
    Salt to taste
    Jaggery – 1 tsp


For the spice paste

    Split Urad Dal – ½ tsp
    Fenugreek seeds – 1 tsp
    Dried Red Chilly – 3 to 4
    Fresh scraped coconut – 1 ½ cup


For Tempering

    Coconut oil – 2 tsp
    Mustard Seeds – 1 tsp
    Curry Leaves – few sprigs


Method

    Soak the tamarind in hot water for 10 minutes and extract the juice from it, by adding about 2 cups of water.
    Add the chopped vegetables, turmeric powder, salt to taste and jaggery.
    Bring to boil and cook on medium flame till the vegetables are done.
    In the meanwhile, heat a small frying pan, with ½ tsp of oil, fry the urad dal,  fenugreek seeds and red chillies. Take care not to burn the fenugreek at the same time it should be fried well else it will give a bitter taste.
    Grind the above with fresh coconut into a smooth paste adding little water.
    Once the veggies are cooked add the ground paste, mix well. Check for seasoning.
    Let this simmer on low flame, remove from flame when the kuzhambu starts frothing. Do not allow to boil.
    Heat a frying pan with the remaining oil, temper with mustard seeds and curry leaves.


Serve hot with plain rice and any thoran or poryial.
