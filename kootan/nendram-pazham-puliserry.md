#  Nendram Pazham Puliserry



Busy days of Navarathri are flying by. It’s already the seventh day. Another two days and there goes this year’s Dassara. Hope all of you are enjoying the festive season.

Coming to today’s post, it is nothing related to Navarathri.  Actually I had wanted to post this before Onam. But due to some constraints couldn’t get around doing it then.






Puliserry is a popular Kerala dish, which is almost an integral part of Sadhyas in some parts of Kerala. It is a spiced coconut and yoghurt gravy which is generally had with rice. Puliserry is generally made with a fruit – the most popular one being Mambazha Puliserry made out of ripe mangoes. Nendram Pazhams (ripe plantains) and Pineapples are also widely used in making Puliserry. It has a lovely blend of fruity, slightly spicy and tangy flavors.

What you’ll need

1.       Ripe Nendram Pazham – 2
2.       Sour Thick Curds – 1 ½ cups
3.       Black Pepper Powder – ½ tsp
4.       Turmeric Powder – a pinch
5.       Salt to taste
6.       Curry Leaves

To Grind

1.       Scraped Coconut – 1 cup tightly packed
2.       Green Chillies – 4 (Adjust according to taste)

For Seasoning

1.       Oil – 1 tsp
2.       Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp
3.       Dried Red Chillies – 1 broken
4.       Fenugreek Seeds – ¼ tsp

Method

Peel Nendram pazham, and cut into big pieces. Boil the pazham pieces in just enough water with turmeric powder, pepper powder and salt.
In the meanwhile, grind the coconut with green chillies into a fine paste. You can use a little of the curd to grind.
Once the pazham pieces are cooked, it should be done in 10 minutes. Add the ground coconut and chillies paste. Mix well. Add about 1/2 cup of water and bring to boil.
Whisk the sour curds and add it to the above mixture. Adjust salt. Give it a nice stir. Simmer until it starts foaming up. Let it not boil. Remove from heat.
In a small frying pan, heat the oil, add mustard seeds, once it crackles add the fenugreek seeds and red chilly. Pour this over the puliserry.  
Yummy Pazham puliserry is ready. Serve with white rice accompanied with a simple vegetable stir fry and some pappadoms.
