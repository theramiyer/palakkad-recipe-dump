#  Moru Keerai/ Spinach in Coconut Yogurt Sauce

I buy spinach every week and end up making either Keerai Molagootal or Masiyal. In one of my general talks with my grandmother, I came to know about his dish Moru keerai, which is almost a forgotten recipe in our household. I tried it once and it was an immediate with my family. I have been making this almost every other week now. I really don't know why, I didn't try this earlier. It is a nice variation to the regular moru kootan. It pairs well with steamed rice and any thoran or a spicy stir fry.


Serves - 3 to 4
What you'll need

    Spinach – 1 bunch
    Coconut – ½ cup, scraped coconut
    Thick Sour Curds – 1 cup
    Dried Red Chilly – 3 to 4
    Fenugreek Seeds – ¼ tsp
    Salt to taste


For tempering

    Oil – 1 tsp
    Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp
    Dried Red Chilly – 1




Method

    Wash and roughly chop the spinach.
    Add it to a vessel and cook covered for 3 to 4 minutes or until the cooked. Do not cook for a long time.
    Transfer to a plate and cool and grind to paste without adding any water.
    In the meanwhile, heat a small frying pan with ½ tsp oil, roast fenugreek seeds and dried red chillies.
    Grind the coconut, roasted fenugreek and red chillies using half the curd to smooth paste.
    Transfer the ground coconut paste to a vessel. Also add the spinach puree and salt to taste.
    Add the remaining curd, and about ½ cup of water. Mix well and simmer till the mixture starts frothing. Do not boil. Adjust consistency by adding more water if required.
    Heat a small frying pan with oil and temper with mustard seeds and dried red chilly.
    Serve moru Keerai with steamed rice and pair it up with a thoran of your choice.




Note:

    You can substitute fenugreek seeds and red chillies with only green chillies while grinding along with coconut. Add fenugreek seeds while tempering.
    Spinach cooks very fast, so do keep it on heat for a long time, else it will lose its green color.
    If using any other variety of greens like Mula keerai, Arai keerai etc, chop finely add a little water and cook covered for a little longer.
