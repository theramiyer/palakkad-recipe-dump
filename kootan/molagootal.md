# Molagootal

_Think Palakkad Chamayal and the first thing that comes to my mind is Molaguttal. One of the easiest dishes to make. Some sweet memories are attached to this. Molaguttal is the first curry I dished out for my husband after our marriage. That was 8 years ago....Time has flied away since then. I still remember those days of cooking with my recipe diary on one end of the kitchen slab....Now let's come back to the present and see how to make this quick and really simple dish of lentils and veggies and ground coconut. _
