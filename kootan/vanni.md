#  Vanni

Vanni is a not so common but very authentic and traditional Palakkad Iyer recipe. My grandmother used to prepare this as an accompaniment with Muthira Puzhukku and Kanji. It is a close cousin of the Mor Kuzhambu. A simple and healthy combination of Naadan Veggies like Ash Gourd, Pumpkin, Raw Bananas, and Yam simmered in mildly spiced thin yogurt gravy. Serve this with steamed white rice and spicy potato stir fry. So here is the recipe for Day 2 of the Blogging Marathon-


What you’ll need Serves – 4

1. Ash gourd – 100 gms
2. Yellow Pumpkin – 100 gms
3. Raw Banana – 1 small
4. Yam – 100 gms
5. Sour curds – 2 cups
6. Green Chillies – 2 to 3
7. Black Pepper Powder – ½ tsp
8. Turmeric Powder – ¼ tsp
9. Curry Leaves a few
10. Coconut Oil – 2 tsps
11. Salt to taste

Method

Wash and chop the vegetables into 1 inch size cubes. Add about ½ cup of water to the veggies and pressure cook them with slit green chillies, turmeric powder and pepper powder. Keep aside. Once the pressure is released, transfer the cooked vegetables into a vessel, add salt to taste and allow to boil for about 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk the curds well, lower the flame and add the curds to the vegetables. Simmer till the curry froths up. (The curry should not boil after adding the curds.) Turn off the flame. Drizzle coconut oil and add a few curry leaves.


Serve it warm with steamed rice and a stir fry of your choice.
