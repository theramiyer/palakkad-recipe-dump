#  Varathu Aracha Kuzhambu



Here is another very flavorful Kuzhambu from my SIL’s mother’s kitchen. A regular in their house, it has become our family favorite too. The aroma and flavor of the roasted and ground coconut and spices makes this kuzhambu really special. A perfect accompaniment with plain rice and a simple stir fry and few pappads. It also pairs very well with idly and dosa.

I have used Pumpkin and ashgourd in this recipe; you can also use drumstick and lady’s finger. If using lady’s finger, sauté lightly and then use. Off to the recipe:

Serves - 3 to 4

What you'll need

    Pumpkin – 1 cup, cubed
    Ashgourd – 1 cup, cubed
    Tamarind – a small gooseberry sized ball
    Turmeric Powder – ¼ tsp
    Salt to taste


Roast and Grind

    Urad Dal – ½ tbsp
    Bengal Gram Dal/Channa Dal – ¼ tbsp
    Fenugreek Seeds – ¼ tsp
    Dried Red Chillies – 2 or 3
    Fresh Scraped Coconut – 1 cup, tightly packed
    Oil – 1 tbsp
    Curry Leaves – few


For Tempering

    Coconut Oil/any refined oil – 2 tsp
    Mustard Seeds – 1 tsp




Method

    Soak the tamarind in one cup of water for 10 minutes.
    Squeeze and extract the pulp from the tamarind.
    Add another cup of water to it.
    Add the chopped vegetables, salt and turmeric powder.
    Bring to boil, cover and cook till the vegetables are cooked.
    In the meanwhile, heat a kadai with a ½ tbsp of oil, and roast the urad dal, channa dal, fenugreek seeds and red chillies, finally add the scraped coconut and roast.
    Add the remaining oil and roast till the coconut turn light brown.
    Add the curry leaves, mix well and remove from flame.
    Grind this into a smooth paste adding about ¼ to ½ cup of water.
    Once the vegetables are cooked, add this ground paste to it and mix well. Add more water if necessary and adjust seasoning..
    Simmer till the gravy starts to froth, do not allow boiling. Remove from heat and garnish with some more curry leaves.
    Heat a small frying pan with 2 tsps of oil, and add mustard seeds. Once it splutters pour it over the kuzhambu.





Delicious Kuzhambu is ready. Serve with plain rice and stir fry of your choice.

Note:

    Don't reduce the amount of coconut as it is one of the main ingredients.
    The gravy tends to thicken a bit on cooling.
