#  Vengaya Sambar/Arachuvitta Vengaya Sambar


Vengaya Sambar and urulaizkizhangu curry are a classic combo. It is no doubt our family favorite too. This combination is usually a weekend special in our house. And I must say that this sambar will taste even better in the night. So whenever you make this sambar try to keep a tiffin like Idly or dosa so that you can enjoy the sambar with it in the evening. :) 
The shallots/chinna vengayam, have a flavor of their own. Together with the freshly ground spices, the Sambar tastes just heavenly.
I learnt a few tip from my mother, like sauteing the onions in a tsp of ghee. This improves the flavor of the sambar. One more thing i would like to share here is that my mother never adds asafoetida/hing/perungayam when adding onions in a dish. That's why you won't find Hing in my list of ingredients here. Now off to the recipe.
