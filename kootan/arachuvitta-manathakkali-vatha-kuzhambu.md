#  Arachuvitta Vatha Kuzhambu (Using Manathakkali Vatthal)


Vatha Kuzhambu is one of my favourites. This is a tangy sauce like preparation, that goes well with rice. It is usually made using dried vegetables or Vathal like Manathakkali, Chundakkai, Kothavarangai etc. But it tastes equally good when made with veggies like shallots, drumstick or even pumkin. My personal favourite is thisChinna Vengaya Vatha Kuzhambu.
As promised in my post, here is my mother's way of making vatha kuzhambu. The freshly ground spices lend an amazing aroma and flavour to it.
I have used Manathakkali vathal in today’s recipe, but feel free to substitute with any other vathal or vegetables like onions, drumstick etc.


Serves - 2 to 3

What you’ll need

    Tamarind – gooseberry sized ball
    Turmeric Powder – ¼ tsp
    Asafoetida/Perumgayam – a generous pinch
    Jaggery – 1 tsp
    For tempering
    Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp
    Manathakkali Vatthal – ¼ cup
    Gingely Oil/Nalla Ennai – 2 tbsp
    Curry Leaves – few


To Roast and Grind

    Channa Dal/Kadalai Paruppu – 2 tbsp
    Coriander Seeds/Dhaniya – 2 tbsp
    Fenugreek Seeds/ Vendayam – ½ tsp
    Cumin Seeds – ½ tsp
    Whole Black Pepper – ¼ tsp (adjust according to taste)
    Dried Red Chilly – 2 or 3 (adjust according to taste)


Method

    Soak the tamarind in 1 cup of hot water for 10 minutes. Squeeze and take out the extract and make it about 2.5 cups by adding more water.
    Heat a small frying pan, with ½ tsp of oil, and fry all the ingredients mentioned under “to roast and grind”.
    Cool, and transfer to a small mixie jar. Powder it first and then add little water and grind to a smooth paste.
    Heat a Kadai with 2 tbsp oil, temper with mustard seeds and curry leaves. Then add the Manathakkali vatthal. Fry for couple of minutes or till the vathhal is fried well.
    Next add the tamarind extract, turmeric powder and asafoetida. Bring this to boil.
    When it starts boiling, add the ground paste and mix well. Add the jaggery and let this boil on medium flame for 10 to 12 minutes, or till the kuzhambu reaches a slightly thick consistency.
    Remove from heat and rest it for atleast 10 minutes before serving.

Serve with rice and Paruppu Thogayal or Kootu.



Note:

    Since my manathakkali vatthal was very salty, I did not add salt to the kuzhambu, so check and add the salt, else the kuzhambu will become salty.
    If you don’t have vathal, you can substitute with any vegetable, like onions, or Drumstick. Add the vegetable after the tempering of mustard seeds and sauté for few minutes before adding the tamarind extract. Also don’t forget to add salt.
