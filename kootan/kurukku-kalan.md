#  Kurukku Kalan/ Onasadhya




Two more days to go for Onam. Generally preparation for the Onam feast would start 2 to 3 days before the D day, like Frying Chips, making the pulinji.

 Kalan or Kurukku kalan is also one such item which can be prepared half way through and the final touches can be given on the day you want to consume it.  No sadhya is complete without Kalan. This is made by concentrating (kurukku) sour curds. Vegetables like Raw Banana and Yam (Chenai) are used to prepare this yummy dish.

My father used to love this. So Kalan was made very often in my house.  But with changing times this has become a rarity. So here is the recipe:

Serves:  4
What you’ll need:
1.       Raw Banana or Plantains – ½ cup
2.       Yam/Chenai – 1/2 cup
3.       Sour thick curd – 2 cups
4.       Freshly ground pepper – 1 tsp
5.       Turmeric powder – a big pinch
6.       Jaggery – a small piece
7.       Salt to taste

To Grind
1.       Scraped Fresh Coconut – 1 cup
2.       Green Chillies – 3 to 4 (Adjust spice according to taste)

For Seasoning
1.       Coconut oil – 1 tsp
2.       Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp
3.       Fenugreek Seeds – ¼ tsp
4.       Dried Red Chillies – 1 or 2
5.       Curry Leaves

Method

    Wash and peel the raw banana and yam. Dice them into 2” square pieces.
    Heat a heavy bottom Kadai, cook the raw bananas and yam pieces in just enough water with turmeric powder and pepper powder. (You could pressure cook it too).
    Whisk the sour curds well and dilute it with 1/2 cup of water add it to the cooked veggies. 
    Now let it cook in slow flame for about 25 to 30 minutes. Keep stirring once in a while. (Make sure that you use really sour curds, else the curds may start splitting.) The curds should reduce to almost ¼ of what you started with. At this stage you can switch off the flame and store in a vessel for further use. This will keep good for even about a month.
    If preparing for immediate use, then grind the coconut and green chillies to a fine paste using a tbsp or 2 of curd. Now add this paste to the concentrated curds and mix well. Add salt and a small piece of jaggery. Mix well.  Let it come to a boil then remove from flame. Do not boil for a long time.
    Heat a Kadai with oil, add mustard seeds, once they splutter add the fenugreek seeds and dried red chillies. Take care not to burn the fenugreek seeds. Pour over the Kalan. Garnish with curry leaves.

Yummy Kalan is ready to be served with some steaming hot white rice.




Note:
Since it is very concentrated, it is mixed in small quantities with rice and eaten.
