#  Vendhaya Keerai Sambar/ Fenugreek Leaves Sambar



Fenugreek Leaves or Methi leaves are one of my favorite greens. I can’t resist a fresh bunch of methi greens. I have grown them in small pots at home a couple of times. They grow very easily and the satisfaction of using something that’s grown by you is immeasurable.
Methi can be used in a variety of dishes like chapathis, gravies, and even rice. You can check some of the recipes using fenugreek leaves Methi Thepla, Methi Malai Matar, Methi Paneer Pulao, Aloo, Paneer and Methi Parathas.

Today’s recipe is one which I learnt from my grandmother. You won’t feel any kind of bitterness which is generally attributed to these greens. A perfect accompaniment with rice and a mild stir fry of your choice. Also goes well with idly and dosa.

Want to share a funny incident that happened while clicking the pics for this recipe. I had roasted a few pappads to use in the background as this sambar tastes great with it. After roasting the them I went to set up everything for taking the pictures. When I went for the pappads, I couldn’t find them anywhere. I could see bits and pieces of pappad lying there and there. I guessed it was the work of my kids. When I went looking for them, both were sitting in one corner of the house munching the pappads with an innocent smile on their faces. Finally, had to click the pics without the papads.
