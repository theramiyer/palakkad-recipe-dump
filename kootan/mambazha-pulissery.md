#  Mambazha Pulissery

Pulissery – a Kerala speciality is sweet and sour, yoghurt and coconut based gravy spiced with green chillies.  Pulissery is a close cousin of Moru Kootan. Acutally there is not much difference except that pulissery generally makes use of seasonal fruits like Ripe Mangoes, Nendram Pazham or Pineapples whereas vegetables like Ash gourd, Pumpkin, Yam etc are added to Moru Kootan. Pulissery is an integral part of the Sadhya/feast Menus in most parts of Kerala. Just like the Adai Avial combo, Idiyappam and Pulissery is a popular combination in Trivandrum.

Mangoes are everywhere in the market and we have been gorging on mangoes in every form. Right from pickles, gravies, milkshakes to smoothies. Couple of days, back I prepared the mambazha pulissery. The pulissery was really delicious and I will be making it a couple of times more before the end of the mango season.

Generally a special variety of mangoes, which are very small and sweet are used. But if they are not available you could use any other ripe mango.
