#  Homemade Rasam Powder/Rasa Podi

Rasam podi or Rasapodi is an indispensable part of my kitchen pantry. As the name suggests this powder is used to make Rasam. I use it not only in rasams but also in different curries. It adds a wonderful flavor to a simple potato fry, lady's finger fry etc.

Now coming to the recipe, this is my grandmother's recipe, which my mother adopted and now I too am following the same. It gives a wonderful flavor to the rasam. Making this powder is quite simple, just gather the ingredients, roast, cool and grind. But care should be taken while roasting. 



What you'll need

    Coriander Seeds / Dhaniya – 3 Cup
    Tuar Dal – 1 Cup
    Channa Dal – 1 Cup
    Jeera – ¾ Cup
    Black Pepper – ¾ Cup
    Mustard – ¼ Cup
    Fenugreek Seeds/Vendhayam – ¼ Cup
    Dried Red Chillies - 1 Cup

Method

    Dry roast all the ingredients one by one.
    Cool completely.
    Grind into a powder and store in airtight containers.


Note

    Though this powder has a long shelf life, I suggest you prepare in smaller quantities to retain the freshness.
    Take care while roasting, never roast on high flame, always roast on a medium flame.
    Also, keep stirring, while roasting so that the whole thing is roasted evenly.
    Store in clean and dry airtight containers and use a dry spoon.
