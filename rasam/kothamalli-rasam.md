#  Kothamalli Rasam / Coriander Rasam

Today's recipe is another signature dish of my MIL. My MIL calls this as "Ammangee Rasam". The first time I heard the name I was very much confused as to why this name. Then she told me how she tasted this rasam first time at her Ammanjee's (Mama's son) and it was he who had made it and so the name. Every time she prepares the rasam she never fails to remember and tell me how tasty and flavorful the rasam was. Indeed it is a very flavorful rasam with all fresh ingredients. Though the color may not look very appealing and that's because of the ground coriander, the taste is amazing. My children like to have as it is in a glass. Now off to the recipe



What you’ll need

    Tuar Dal – 2 tbsp, cooked and mashed
    Tamarind – a marable sized ball
    Turmeric Powder – ¼ tsp
    Asafoetida – a generous pinch
    Salt to taste


To Grind

    Tomato – 2 big
    Coriander Stems with leaves – 25
    Ginger – a small piece
    Garlic – a big pod (optional)

    Black Pepper – ¼ tsp
    Cumin Seeds – ½ tsp


To Temper

    Oil/ghee – tsp

Method

    Soak the tamarind in about ½ cup of water for about 10 to 1 5 minutes.
    Squeeze and extract the juice and discard the fiber
    Grind all the items mentioned under “to grind” to a smooth paste without adding any water.
    Transfer this ground paste to a vessel.
    To the ground paste add the tamarind juice.
    Also add turmeric powder, asafoetida and salt to taste.
    Add 2 cups of water
    Bring this to boil and boil for 7 to 8 minutes or until the raw smell disappears.
    Reduce the heat to lowest. Mix the mashed dal with 1 cup of water and add it to the rasam.
    Simmer until the rasam starts frothing up. Do not boil.
    Remove from flame.
