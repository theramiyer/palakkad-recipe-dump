#  Tomato Lemon Rasam

Today’s recipe, Rasam is a popular south Indian dish. It is a must during any feast and is generally served as the second course with rice. Most of my North Indian friends, I have seen love to drink this in a glass or bowl like a soup. There are many different kinds of rasam the popular ones being Tomato Rasam, Lemon Rasam, Pepper Rasam, Jeera Rasam etc. So, whether you decide to drink a warm glass of this appetizing soup or have it with rice and spicy potato fry with sutta applam the choice is yours, it is just perfect for the wintery months.

I was always very apprehensive about posting a recipe for Rasam. It is indeed quite simple to make but I thought it would definitely benefit people like me.  If rasam was being made, I would generally escape from the kitchen giving some reason or the other. The reason being, though it is very easy to make, still it needs to be made perfectly with the perfect blend of its main ingredients tamarind and other spices. Initially when I used to prepare rasam, it would become either too sour, or it would be very watery or spicy something or the other would go wrong. Now, with lot of trials, I have kind of mastered it.

Before my marriage rasam to me, would mean only say two kinds, tomato rasam and Jeera Rasam. It was only after I got married and saw my MIL make a different one each day, that I realized Rasam could be made in so many different forms each one having its own unique trademark taste. Today’s recipe is one such, which I learnt from her, that she in turn learnt from her MIL. Whenever my MIL prepares this rasam she would always think of her MIL and say that this was her signature dish, now I feel this is my MIL’s signature dish. My younger one simply loves this and she enjoys having this as such in a glass and with everything like, idly, dosa and ofcourse rice!
