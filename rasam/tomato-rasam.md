#  Tomato Rasam using Homemade Rasa Podi


A simple rasam, rice and potato fry is a heavenly combination, best for one of those cold nights. Rasam is a staple in most south Indian homes and so is the case in our home as well. My younger daughter loves rasam and she has it with almost everything, Idly, Dosa, even Chapathi. She loves to drink it as such, like a soup. 

So here is how I make the tomato rasam with the Rasam Powder. Don't ask me why I took so long to post this. Anyways, better late than never isn't it?




Serves 3 to 4

What you'll need

    Tuar Dal – 1 tbsp
    Tamarind – small gooseberry sized ball
    Tomato – 1
    Turmeric Powder – ¼ tsp
    Rasa Podi – 1 tbsp
    Asafoetida – a generous pinch
    Powdered Jaggery – 1 tsp
    Salt to taste
    Curry Leaves – few sprigs
    Coriander Leaves – Finely chopped – 2 tbsp


For tempering

    Ghee – 1 tsp
    Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp
    Jeera – ½ tsp


Method

    Pressure cook dal, mash well adding about 1.5 cups of water. Keep aside.
    Soak the tamarind in hot water and extract about 2 cups of thin tamarind extract.
    Add finely chopped tomatoes, asafoetida, turmeric powder, rasam powder, jaggery and salt to taste.
    Also add the curry leaves.
    Let this come to a boil, simmer for 8 to 10 minutes on low heat.
    Now add the cooked dal water, check for seasoning. Adjust taste and add more water if required.
    Simmer on low heat until the rasam froths up. Do not allow to boil.
    Garnish with chopped coriander leaves.
    Heat a small frying pan with ghee, add mustard seeds, once they start crackling add jeera and pour over the rasam.


Cover and keep until serving.
Enjoy with plain steamed rice, a vegetable curry and some papad.
