#  Jeera Rasam


It has been really cold the past week here. What better way to enjoy the chilly days with a comfort food of rasam, rice and pappadam. Rasam is an all time favourite at our home. My younger one likes to drink it as such. This Jeera rasam is one of her favourites.

This is a very simple rasam with no addition of even dal. Just a few regular ingredients and you have a hearty rasam ready in minutes. This rasam is great on the days when you are down with fever, cold or cough. The black pepper and cumin have a soothing effect.

What you’ll need

    Tamarind – gooseberry sized ball
    Pepper Powder – ½ - 1 tsp
    Jeera Powder – 1.5 tsp
    Turmeric Powder – ¼ tsp
    Salt to taste
    Curry Leaves – few springs


For tempering

    Ghee – 1 tsp
    Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp
    Jeera – ½ tsp


Method

    Soak the tamarind in 1 cup of hot water for 10 to 15 minutes
    Squeeze and take out the extract. Add about 2 cups of water to this and transfer it to a vessel.
    Now add the turmeric powder, pepper powder, and salt to taste. Also tear a few curry leaves and add it.
    Now bring this to a boil. Let it boil for 6 to 8 minutes now add the jeera powder and around a cup more of water.
    Simmer until the rasam starts frothing.
    Remove from heat.
    Heat a small frying pan with ghee, add the mustard seeds and cumin seeds. Pour the tempering over the rasam. Cover and rest it for few minutes before serving. The resting time is for the flavours to mingle well.


Serve hot with rice and vazhakkai Chenai mezhukkuperatti or drink it as it is.
