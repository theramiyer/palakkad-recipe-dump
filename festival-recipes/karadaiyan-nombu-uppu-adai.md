#  Karadaiyan Nombu Uppu Adai


Karadaiyan Nonbu is just around the corner. Also known as Savitri Vrat, Karadayan Nonbu ritual is observed by all married women for the well being of their husband and that the couples should remain together always. Unmarried women also observe Karadaiyan Nonbu and pray to Goddess Shakti to get good men as their husband. To know the legend behind this  festival check out my post on Sweet Karadaiyan Nombu adai.

This is the savory version of the adai. This is also one of those recipes which I had not tasted until marriage. Ever since this one has taken precedence over the sweet one. Here is the recipe:




Makes about 16 small adais
What you’ll need

    Rice Flour – 1 ½ cup
    Water – 2 ¼ cup
    Coconut - 1/4 cup, cut into small pieces
    Salt to taste


For tempering

    Oil – 1 tbsp (preferable coconut oil)
    Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp
    Channa Dal – 1 tsp
    Green chilly – 1 or 2 (adjust according to taste)
    Asafoetida – a generous pinch
    Curry Leaves – few torn




Method

    Heat a Kadai, add the rice flour and dry roast for about 3 to 4 minutes, until a good aroma starts coming. (Make sure the color doesn’t change)
    Transfer into a plate and keep aside.
    Heat a Kadai with oil, add the mustard seeds, once they splutter add the channa dal, fry till the dal turns golden.
    Next add the asafoetida, chopped green chillies and curry leaves.
    Now add the measured amount of water, salt and coconut pieces.
    Once the water starts boiling, add the rice flour, stirring simultaneously.
    The whole thing will come together as a whole mass.
    Remove from flame and allow to cool slightly or till you can handle with bare hands.
    Knead well.
    Pinch out lemon sized balls, flatten and make a hole in the centre with your finger.
    Repeat the same with the remaining dough.
    Grease idli moulds and place the prepared adais one in each groove.
    Steam for 8 to 10 minutes or till the adais appear shiny.
    Remove from heat and cool.


Uppu adais are ready. Serve warm



Note:

Heat an extra 1/2 cup of water, and use as required if you feel your dough is very dry. The amount of water required depends on the rice flour you are uisng.
Do not roast the rice flour too much as the color of the adais will change.
