#  Ellu Kozhukattai



I always considered making kozhukattais a herculean task. Making the outer layer, preparing the filling and then assembling the kozhukattais and finally steaming them. Now that is quite a lot of work isn’t it. Maybe that was one of the reasons why, my mom did not prepare it much. Poornam kozhukattais signified, Vinayagar Chathurthi, hence would be prepared once in a year on the particular day.  Also, my mom and grandmom, made only 2 kinds of kozhukattais, one sweet with a coconut and jaggery filling and the other a savoury version with Urad dal.

 But after marriage, I saw my MIL making these kozhukattais, every month for Sankatahara Chathurthi. She fasts on this day until moon rise and prepares poornam kozhukattais as offering to Lord Ganesha. I was amazed at the ease with which she prepared these kozhukattais. Not even a single one would crack or break. They turn out perfect each and every time. Also I discovered that apart from the 2 fillings which I was familiar with, a whole lot of different fillings and variations could be done to get yummy and delicious kozhukkatais. Out of the various fillings which my Mil prepares, the sesame and jaggery is my favourite. I just love the flavour of sesame in it.
The outer layer can be prepared in many ways, here I have described using rice flour (idiyappam flour). It can also be prepared by soaking and grinding raw rice. Will try to post that also soon, meanwhile enjoy these:



Makes about 10 Medium sized kozhukattais

What you’ll need
For the filling

    White Til/Ellu/Sesame – ½ cup
    Powdered Jaggery – ½ cup


For the outer covering

    Rice flour (Idiyappam flour) – ½ cup
    Hot water – ½ cup + 1/4 cup use only if required
    Coconut Oil /Sesame oil – 1 tsp + for greasing
    Salt – a pinch


Method

    Dry roast the sesame seeds till golden brown. Cool.
    Powder the sesame in a mixer jar. Pulse for 30 secs then again for 30 secs and check. Do not run the mixer for a long time else oil will start releasing from the sesame.
    Now add the powdered jaggery and pulse again till they are mixed well. Transfer into a bowl.
    Form small balls out of this powder. No need to add any ghee or water for binding. It maybe a little difficult to form the balls, but they will be formed.
    For the outer covering
    Bring 1 cup of water to boil. Add a tsp of coconut oil or sesame oil.
    Take the idiyappam flour in a bowl, add a pinch of salt and mix well.
    Now add ½ cup of hot water to the flour and mix well with the help of a wooden spatula. Add more water if required. Knead into a smooth dough.
    Grease your palms and pinch out small lemon sized balls out of the dough. Flatten the dough in your palms and place a sesame jaggery ball in the center. Gather the edges and seal the filling forming a peak at the top. (just like you would do for the stuffed paratha). Prepare more kozhukattais using the remaining dough and filling.
    Heat a steamer, you can also use the idli stand. Place the kozhukattais one by one without touching each other and steam for 10 minutes or until the outer layer is shiny.




Note:

    Always keep a little extra hot water, and add the water depending on the requirement. Amount of water may vary depending on the quality of rice powder.


Variations:

    You could add a little coconut scrapings in the filling.
    You can also flavour the filling with cardamom, but I like the sesame flavour and did not flavour it with anything else.
