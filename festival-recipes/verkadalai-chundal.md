#  Spicy Verkadalai Sundal/ Spicy Peanut Sundal


Think Navarathri and two things that immediately come to my mind are Golu – arrangement of doll in steps and sundals. A variety of sundals are prepared on each of the nine days. Even though, sweets are also prepared but somehow, everybody seems to be more inclined towards this humble dish – Sundal. Sundal is a simple dish, made out of steamed legumes like Chickpeas, Mung Beans, Cowpeas, Peanuts etc. Though, it may seem humble, each kind is a powerhouse of proteins and nutrients. Moreover these are steamed and tempered in just about a teaspoon of oil and hence they are all the more healthy. A totally guilt free and healthy snack that can be relished not only during the festive season but even otherwise.

Verkadalai sundal is by far my favorite one. I think if you take a popularity vote, this sundal would top the list, since peanuts are generally liked by young and old alike. So here is my way of making this sundal. The tempering and flavor is slightly different from the regular ones with coconut. I like this version a lot. Read on to find out about this slightly different preparation:

What you’ll need

1.       Raw peanuts – 1 cup
2.       Coriander seeds – 2 tsps
3.       Dried Red Chillies – 2 (Adjust according to taste)
4.       Asafetida – a big pinch
5.       Salt to taste

For Tempering

1.       Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp
2.       Curry Leaves – Few



Method

Soak the peanuts in water for about 2 hours. Drain the water, wash the peanuts, and about ¼ cup of water and pressure cook it for about 3 whistles. Drain the water and keep aside.

Heat a Kadai, dry roast the coriander seeds and red chillies till a nice aroma comes. Grind it into a powder and keep aside.

Now in the same Kadai, heat a tsp of oil, add mustard seeds. Once the seeds splutter, add curry leaves. Next toss in the cooked peanuts, add the spice powder, asafetida and salt to taste. Stir well for a minute.
Yummy and tasty verkadalai sundal is ready.
