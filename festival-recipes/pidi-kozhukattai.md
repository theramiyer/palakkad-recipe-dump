#  Pidi Kozhakattai/Steamed Sweet Rice Dumplings


Pidi Kozhakattai is one of those numerous varieties of kozhakattais that is offered to Lord Ganesha. This is specifically made for Sankatahara Chathurthi, which falls on the the 4th day (chathurthi) after the full moon (Pournami). This is again one of those dishes, of which I came to know of only after marriage. 

My MIL who fasts on every Sankatahara Chathurthi, prepares these kozhakattais as offerings to Lord Ganesha and has them in the night after moonrise.

This is really easy to make not like the Poornam Kozhakattai, which takes lot of time and requires patience and practice. The procedure for making these Pidi Kozhakattais are very much similar to making the Thiruvadhirai Kali. These are not very sweet and can be easily made as a snack in the evening.




What you'll need

    Rice – 1 cup
    Powdered Jaggery – 2 cups
    Freshly Scraped Coconut - 1/4 to 1/2 cup
    Water – 2 ½ cups
    Cardamom – 3 or 4 pods
    Ghee/Clarified Butter -


Method

    Wash the rice and drain completely.
    Dry roast in a Kadai until brown. Take care not to brown.
    Powder in a mixie to rava consistency.
    Heat the same kadai with 2 ½ cups of water. Bring to boil.
    Add a teaspoon of ghee. Also add the grated coconut.
    Once the water starts boiling, slowly add the roasted powdered rice and mix vigorously.
    Cover and cook on low heat until all the water is absorbed.
    In the meanwhile, heat another kadai simultaneously.
    Add the powdered jaggery and ¼ cup of water.
    Let the jaggery dissolve fully, strain for impurities.
    Pour this jaggery syrup into the rice mixture and keep stirring.
    Add about 2 to 3 teaspoons of ghee. And stir until, the mixture thickens and starts leaving the sides of the kadai.
    Add the powdered cardamoms and mix well.
    Cool slightly, grease palms and shape into dumplings with your hands.
    Steam in an idly cooker or steamer for 10 minutes.


Note:

    The amount of jaggery mentioned is perfect for us, but if you like it to be more sweet you can add upto another 1/2 cup of jaggery.
    The method of cooking the rice flour first in boiling water, ensures that the rice cooks properly. You made add it directly to the jaggery syrup to, but, it will take longer to cook and sometimes, may not cook properly too.
