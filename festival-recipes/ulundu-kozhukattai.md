#  Ulundu Kozhukattai





Preparations for Ganesh Chathurthi must have started in full swing in most parts of the country. Both in Bangalore and Hyderabad, huge idols of Ganesha can be seen adorning almost all the streets. You can see the Lord depicted in different forms. You can find him posing with a cricket bat or kicking a foot ball. You might also find him playing various musical instruments or in a dance posture. Don’t be surprised if you find him in some yoga postures as well! I love collecting idols of Ganesha in different forms and I do have a small collection. But since we shifted to this new apartment, I have not been able to take out my Ganeshas and put them on display :)

As we all know from the many mythological stories, that Ganesha loves to eat, So it is a practice to offer a wide array of offerings on the Ganesh Chathurthi, his favorite being the Modak or Poorna Kozhukattai. Along with this savory kozhukattais, nei appam, idlis, Chakkara Pongal, Vadai etc are also prepared.

I have already posted kozhukattais with 2 different sweet fillings. Today I am sharing a savory one.


15 to 16 medium sized Kozhukattais

What you'll need

For the outer covering

    Rice Flour/Idiyappam Flour – 1 cup
    Water – 1 cup +1/4 cup use only if required
    Salt – a pinch
    Sesame oil – 1 tsp + little more for greasing your palms


For the filling

    White Urad Dal – ½ cup
    Fresh Scraped Coconut – ½ cup
    Green Chillies – 2
    Curry Leaves – few sprigs
    Oil – 2 tsp
    Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp
    Asafoetida – a generous pinch
    Salt to taste


Method

    Wash and soak the urad dal for 20 minutes. Discard the water, and rinse in fresh water again. Drain completely.
    Grind this along with green chillies and curry leaves into a very coarse paste, without adding any water.
    Transfer into a bowl, add salt and mix well.
    Grease an idli mould, take a little of the ground dal paste and pat it into the groves.
    Steam this for 6 to 7 minutes or till a knife inserted comes out clean.
    Let this cool. Remove from mould and pulse in a mixer till the dal resembles a coarse powder.
    Heat a non stick frying pan with oil, splutter mustard seeds and add a generous pinch of asafoetida.
    Now add the dal powder and scraped coconut and stir well for 5 to 6 minutes.
    Cool and transfer into a bowl. Shape into small oblong shaped balls.
    Take the idiyappam flour in a bowl. Add a pinch of salt and mix well.
    Bring 1 cup of water to boil add the oil.
    Now add the hot water, about ½ cup at a time and mix well with a wooden spatula. Set aside to cool slightly. Knead into smooth dough with your hands while still warm. Do not allow the mixture to get too cold, start kneading when you can handle the mixture with your hands.
    Grease your palms and pinch out small lemon sized balls out of the dough. Flatten the dough in your palms and place a ball of prepared filling in the center.  Fold into half to form crescent shape and seal the edges. Prepare more kozhukattais using the remaining dough and filling.
    Heat a steamer, you can also use the idli stand. Place the kozhukattais one by one without touching each other and steam for 10 minutes or until the outer layer is shiny.




Note:
While making the outer layer, add water little by little once the dough seems to comes together stop adding water. Cool and knead with hands. Add drops of hot water if required later. Keep the dough covered till the filling is ready.
