#  Vazhakkai Podimas



Raw banana, pumpkin, ash gourd and yam are few vegetables which are almost always present in my refrigerator. Without these I feel at loss when cooking my day to day meals. Invariably atleast one, or a combination of these veggies are used almost every day in our house. Be it in Molagootal, Moru Kootan, Avial, Olan or Mezhukuperatti.

We generally prepare mezhukuperatti with raw bananas or sometimes this spicy raw banana curry. Podimas is not a frequent affair in my household; I really can’t pinpoint the reason for it. So whenever it is made, there are no leftovers, it just disappears.
Here is my version:

What you’ll need

    Vazhakkai/Raw Banana – 2 Medium
    Fresh Scraped Coconut – ¼ to ½ cup
    Green Chilly – 1 or 2
    Ginger – a small piece
    Turmeric Powder – ¼ tsp
    Salt to taste


For Seasoning

    Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp
    Broken Urad Dal – 1 tsp
    Curry Leaves – 6 to 7 torn
    Oil – 1 tbsp




Method

    Cut the raw bananas into 2 or 3 big pieces with the skin.
    In a deep vessel add enough water and boil the plantain pieces with turmeric powder till just done.
    Do not overcook then the whole podimas will become mushy. Cook until the peel comes of easily.
    Cool and remove the skin and grate.
    Heat a Kadai with oil, add mustard seeds once it starts spluttering add urad dal. Fry till it starts turning golden. Next add curry leaves and the grated plantains.
    Add salt to taste and mix well.
    Let this fry on low heat for 7 to 8 minutes. Stir once in a while.
    Crush the coconut, green chilly and ginger into a coarse paste without adding water.
    Add this to the plantains mix well. Remove from heat.
    Serve hot with a plain rice and Sambar or Rasam.




Note:

Usually juice of about half a lemon is added at the end, as I don’t like it I don’t add it. You may add if you like a tangy taste.
