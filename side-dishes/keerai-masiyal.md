#  Keerai Masiyal

Spinach and all greens are a real powerhouse of vitamins and minerals. Rich in iron, calcium and folic acid. It is recommended that we eat greens on daily basis: - at least a small portion.
Here’s a very simple recipe, which can be prepared within 10 minutes time. Most of the Keerai Masiyal recipes incorporate garlic, onions and tomatoes. The recipe that I am posting today is a typical Brahmin recipe in which the taste of the keerai is dominant.

Ingredients

1.       Spinach or any other greens – 1 big bunch
2.       Dried red chillies – 2
3.       Urad Dal – 1 tsp
4.       Mustard Seeds – 1 tsp
5.       Coconut Oil – 1 tsp
6.       Salt to taste


Method

Wash the greens very well. Drain out excess water. Chop them roughly.
Heat a pan, add the greens. (No need to add water if you are using Spinach i.e. palak. For other varieties like Ara keerai, mula keerai etc add a little water) Cook covered till the greens are soft.
Allow to cool. Grind it for a just about 30 seconds. Take care that it does not become a very fine paste.
Transfer into a bowl. Add salt to taste and mix well.
Heat coconut oil, add mustard seeds, urad dal and red chillies. Once the mustard splutters and the dal turns red pour this on the Spinach Paste.
Keerai Masiyal is ready. Can be served as an accompaniment to Sambar or Mor Kootan. Or you can simple mix the Masiyal with rice and have it.
