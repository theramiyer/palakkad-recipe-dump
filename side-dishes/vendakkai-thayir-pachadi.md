#  Vendakkai Thayir Pachadi




While browsing through my recipes, I found that I have not blogged a single Thayir Pachadi recipe. Actually, I am not a big fan of thayir pachadis or raithas. Maybe that’s the reason why I haven’t posted one.  Even though it’s not something which I would savour to its last drop, it does find its way into my kitchen very frequently – reason, my children. Both are big fans of it and they can simply have bowlfuls of the pachadi and say that they’ve finished lunch!

 I prefer this Lady’s finger pachadi over the numerous varieties of thayir pachadis. So I thought of opening this category with my favourite choice.

The title should have rightly been Venkakkai Kichadi – as curd based pachadis are known as Kichadi and form an important part of the Sadhya or feast. But in our house we just refer to them as Thayir pachadi so I stuck with that name. You could use other veggies, like cooked ashgourd pieces, or banana stem pieces as well instead of lady’s finger. Tastes best as an accompaniment with rice and Molagootal or Molaguhsyam.

Serves - 4
What you’ll need

    Lady’s Finger /Vendakkai – 200 gms
    Green Chillies – 1 or 2
    Fresh Grated Coconut – ½ cup
    Fresh Thick Curd – 2 Cups
    Mustard Seeds –1/4 tsp
    Curry Leaves – few
    Salt to taste
    Oil – 2 tsp


For Tempering

    Oil – 1 tsp
    Mustard Seeds – 1 tsp


Method

    Wash and pat dry the lady’s finger. Cut into small pieces.
    Heat a kadai with oil. Add the lady’s finger pieces, cover and cook for about 5 minutes.
    Remove the lid and fry for another 5 to 10 minutes, on low heat, stirring every now and then.
    Once the lady’s finger is fried well, add salt and mix well.
    Remove from heat. And let it cool.
    In the meanwhile, grind coconut, green chillies, mustard seeds and curry leaves to a smooth paste adding a little water.
    Beat the curd well, add the coconut paste and fried lady’s finger. Mix well and check for seasoning.
    Heat a small frying pan with a tsp of oil. Add mustard seeds. Once they splutter pour the seasoning over the pachadi.



That’s it, delicious Vendakkai Thayir Pachadi is ready.

Serve as an accompaniment with rice and molagootal or Molagushyam or even with rotis.
