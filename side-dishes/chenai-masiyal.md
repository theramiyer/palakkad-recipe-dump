#  Chenai Masiyal/Senai Masiyal/Yam Mash


Chenai Masiyal is nothing but mashed yam, seasoned with some spices and garnished with lemon juice. It’s a perfect accompaniment with Keerai Molagootal or for that matter any Molagootal. It tasted good with even simple dal. It’s a good accompaniment with rotis too. It needs just a few ingredients. And it is the simplest thing to make. I guess I have given you enough reasons to get into your kitchen and make it right away.

This Masiyal can be made two ways, one is this way using lemon juice and the other is using tamarind. Will try to post the tamarind version too.



Serves 2 to 3
What you'll need

    Chenai/Yam – about 250 gms, 1.5 cups approx when chopped
    Ginger – a small piece
    Green Chilly – 1 or 2 (adjust according to taste)
    Lemon Juice – ½ tbsp
    Turmeric Powder – ¼ tsp
    Salt to taste


For tempering

    Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp
    Fenugreek Seeds – ¼ tsp
    Dried Red Chilly – 1
    Curry Leaves – few
    Coconut oil – 1 tsp


Method

    Peel and roughly chop the yam into chunks. Wash well.
    Slit green chillies, peel and grate ginger.
    In a small pressure cooker, add the chopped yam pieces, green chillies, ginger, turmeric powder and salt.
    Add just enough water to cover the yam pieces.
    Cook for 3 whistles. The yam pieces should be cooked really well.
    Once pressure is released, Strain the water and set aside. Don’t throw it.
    Mash the yam pieces with a masher or back of a ladle until there are no more pieces left.
    Check for salt. Add the reserved water little at a time and make to a saucy consistency.
    Heat a small frying pan with oil, temper with mustard, fenugreek and red chillies.
    Remove from heat and add the curry leaves.
    Now pour this tempering over the mashed yam mixture.
    Let it cool for a while then add the lemon juice and mix well.





Serve with rice and Molagootal or even as a side to Chappathis.

Note:
Add just enough water to the yam, while pressure cooking it.
You can also cook them on stove top, but I find pressure cooking easier.
The consistency of the masiyal should be sauce like..not too thick or not too thin.y
