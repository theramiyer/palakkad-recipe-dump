#  Manga Chammanthi/ Raw Mango Chutney


Hello Friends,
It feels great to be back to blogging after a break of 10 days. Had been for a vacation to Mysore. It feels really good, my energy levels are up after the much needed vacation.

My H and his entire family are lovers of mango, mangoes in any form – be it a puliserry or a simple mangai curry. Mangoes are a part of our daily meals from the beginning to the end of the season. MIL makes many different kinds of dishes with it. Mangai chammanthi is one of her favorites.
This is a traditional Kerala dish. It is a real quickie and can get ready in less than 15 minutes. This spicy and tangy chammanthi goes very well with Molagootal, Molagushyam, and curd rice. It is also an excellent combination for Dosa and Idly, but apart from all these it is best had with Kanji. So here is the recipe for this summer special Manga Chammanthi.




What you will need:

1. Raw mango – (cut into pieces) 1 cup
2. Grated fresh coconut – 1 cup
3. Asfoetida – a small piece
4. Dry Red Chillies – 5 – 6
5. Salt to taste
6. Jaggery – a little (optional)
7. Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp
8. Oil – 1 tsp

Method:

Heat a small frying pan with ½ tsp of oil. Fry the asfoetida and red chillies. Now grind the raw mangoes, grated coconuts, asfoetida, red chillies and salt into a thick paste adding very little water. Add a little jaggery and pulse for a few seconds more. Transfer into a bowl. Heat a little oil, add mustard seeds. Once they splutter pour over the ground paste. Mangai Chammanthi is ready.



Note:

    Adjust the quantity of coconut depending of the sourness of the mango. Use more coconut if the mango is very sour.
    Addition of jaggery is optional, adding a little though helps in balancing out the spice and tang.
