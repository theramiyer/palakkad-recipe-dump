#  Chakka Curry/ Jackfruit Curry


Summer is the time, when the markets get flooded with mangoes and jackfruits. Every year, we buy at least a couple of big jackfruits, one would be definitely for Vishu. I have wanted to post the recipe for Chakka varati and Chakka Pradhaman for a long time. I had been talking about this in my house, so my FIL was very eager to get a one.

Couple of weeks back, they had gone to Cuddalore to visit a temple and on their return, they changed the route and came via Panruti town (famous for jackfruits), just to buy one for me. On going into the town, they could not find even a single one, when enquired about the fruit, locals said, that most of the trees had been uprooted during the cyclone which hit Tamil Nadu few months back. So they had to come back empty handed. Even for Vishu we just bought a few jackfruit bulbs and not the whole fruit.

Then one day, my FIL came home, after his routine temple visit, with a huge sack. And what was inside it? Yes you guessed right! He had somehow managed to get 3 jackfruits. So with one of them, we made this Chakka Curry. The other two are still sitting and getting ripened.
Chakka Curry is a popular and traditional Kerala dish. This curry requires jackfruit, that is neither completely raw nor fully ripe. The fruit should be pale yellow and when tasted, it will have a slight sour taste. That kind of fruit will be perfect for this Chakka curry, which is slightly sweet and sour and fully of flavours from the roasted coconut.





What you'll need

    Jackfruit – 4 Cups, deseeded and diced
    Cowpeas – ½ cup
    Turmeric Powder – ¼ tsp
    Chilly Powder – 1/2  tsp
    Salt to taste


To Grind

    Freshly scraped Coconut – ¾ cup
    Cumin Seeds – 1 tsp


For Tempering

    Coconut oil – 1 tbsp
    Freshly scraped Coconut – ½ cup
    Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp
    Urad Dal – 1 tsp
    Dried Red Chilly – 2

Method

    Soak the cowpeas for 10 to 15 minutes in hot water.
    Pressure cook it for 3 whistles or until done.
    In a vessel add the chopped jackfruit pieces, turmeric powder, chilly powder and salt to taste.
    Add about 1.5 cups of water and cook partially covered on medium heat for 6 to 8 minutes or until the jackfruit is cooked. Keep stirring in between to avoid burning.
    Add the cooked cowpeas without water and boil for another 5 minutes.
    In the meanwhile, grind coconut and cumin seeds to fine paste using very little water. You can use the left over water of the cooked cowpeas.
    Add the ground paste to the cooked jackfruit mix well. Check seasoning, simmer for 3 to 4 minutes and remove from heat.
    Heat another frying pan with oil, add the coconut and roast until dark brown.
