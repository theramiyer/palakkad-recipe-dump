#  Vendakkai Puli/Vendakkai Puli Pachadi

Lady’s finger is our family’s favourite vegetable. We like it in Sambar, Thayir Pachadi, a simple stir fry or like this puli pachadi. This is a tangy sauce prepared using tamarind, lady’s finger and some simple spices. It tastes great with Molagootal or even with curd rice.



Serves – 3 to 4
What you’ll need

    Lady’s Finger - 10 to 12 Medium sized
    Tamarind – Gooseberry sized ball
    Ginger – a small piece
    Green Chilly – 1, slit
    Sambar Podi – ½ tbsp
    Jaggery – 1 tbsp
    Turmeric Powder – ¼ tsp
    Salt to taste
    Oil – 1 tsp
    Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp
    Curry Leaves – few


Method

    Soak the tamarind in hot water for 10 minutes.
    Squeeze and extract the pulp with about 2 cups of water.
    Wash and pat dry the lady’s finger and cut into ½ inch sized pieces.
    Heat a Kadai with oil, temper with mustard seeds.
    Add the curry leaves, slit green chilly, grated ginger and sauté for a min.
    Add the lady’s finger, turmeric powder and sambar powder and fry on medium flame for 3 to 4 minutes.
    Add the 2 cups of tamarind water, Jaggery and salt to taste.
    Bring to boil, then lower the heat and let it boil for another 8 to 10 minutes or until the sauce thickens slightly.
    Remove from heat.


Serve warm with Keerai Molagootal.



Note:

    Don’t skip the ginger and green chilly as they give a special flavour to the pachadi.
    You can substitute the Rasam powder with Sambar powder or ½ tsp of chilli powder.
    At the end if you feel the sauce is not thickened enough to your liking, you can mix a tsp of rice flour in water and add and bring to a boil. I personally don’t like to add rice flour.
