#  Kadachakka Thoran/ Breadfruit Thoran




My stay in Bangalore this vacation was really fruitful. Fruitful in terms of my blog, I tried out many different recipes and also asked my mother to prepare some of the traditional recipes which I had not tried or had for a long time.  One of my friends got this Kada Chakka, or breadfruit from Kerala. It was from the tree grown in their backyard.I was setting my eyes on this fruit for the first time. The name Kada Chakka made me picture it as a small jackfruit. It did look like a small jackfruit.  Still I had my doubts about its taste. But my friend persuaded me to take it home and asked me to just make a simple mezhukkuperatti or thoran with it. I hesitantly took it home. My mom also had never tasted it but had seen it and had heard about it.  

The next day, we prepared a thoran with it and it really tasted good. It tasted very much like potatoes. And all the flavours blended very well with it. My daughter liked it a lot. So the next time I sight it somewhere I am sure going to grab this fruit and try out different recipes. For those who would like to know more about breadfruit please visit this page.



What you’ll need

    Kada Chakka – 1, medium
    Grated Coconut – 3 tbsp
    Green Chilly – 1 or 2

Method

    Peel the skin of the bread fruit and chop into medium sized cubes.
    Steam cook the bread fruit pieces in a pressure cooker for 2 whistles. Do not add any water to the pieces while cooking.
    Heat a kadai with oil, add mustard seeds and urad dal. Once the mustard splutters and urad dal turns light brown, add the steamed bread fruit pieces. Add turmeric powder and salt to taste. Mix well. Fry on medium flame for 3 to 4 minutes.
    In the meanwhile, grind coconut, green chilly and curry leaves to a coarse paste, without adding water.
    Add this ground paste to the bread fruit pieces and mix well.
