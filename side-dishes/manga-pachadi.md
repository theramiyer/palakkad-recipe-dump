#  Maangai Pachadi/ Mango Pachadi



The term pachadi refers to fresh pickles in Andhra, whereas in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, it is a side dish made of vegetable. It’s really amazing how a particular word can mean many different things in different part of our country. But what is in a name, call it pachadi, or gojju, the preparations are very similar with slight differences of the region. That’s what I love about our country.

Pachadi – in Palakkad Iyer lingua, is a saucy preparation, generally served as an accompaniment to Molagootal or Molagushiyam. A pachadi can be a puli pachadi as in tamarind based, like Mathan Pachadi or Pavaka Pachadi or Thayir Pachadi where the base is yoghurt. The tamarind based pachadis just taste awesome with a fusion of sweet, spice and tang. Vegetables like Pumpkin, Bittergourd, Brinjals, Lady’s Finger, and Mangoes are commonly used to prepare this.

When mangoes are in season, no doubt it rules my kitchen. So, once in 3 to 4 days, this pachadi sees its way into my hearth. My children love this when compared to pachadis made of any other vegetable. A mango that’s not too sour would be good for this recipe. So here is another mango recipe from my kitchen:



Serves 4
What you’ll need

    Kili Mooku Maangai – 1 Big
    Chilly Powder – 1 tsp
    Turmeric Powder – ¼ tsp
    Jaggery – 2 tbsp
    Salt to taste


For Tempering

    Coconut oil – 2 tsp
    Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp
    Fenugreek Seeds – ¼ tsp
    Dried Red Chilly – 1 to 2, broken
    Curry Leaves – few


Method

    Wash and cut the mango into medium sized pieces.
    Heat a Kadai, add the mango pieces to it and add water, such that the level of water is just above the mango pieces.
    Add turmeric powder, chilly powder and salt to taste.
    Cover and cook for about 5 to 6 minutes on medium flame, stirring in between.
    Remove lid, the mangoes should have almost cooked, add the jaggery and simmer for another 5 minutes on low flame or till the pachadi thickens a bit and attains a saucy consistency.
    Heat a small frying pan with oil.
    Add mustard seeds once they start crackling, add the fenugreek seeds and broken red chillies. Let the fenugreek seeds turn golden brown then add the curry leaves and pour this over the pachadi.



That’s it tasty and tangy Mango pachadi is ready. Serve it as an accompaniment with Molagootal or Molagutiam, rice and dal or even with curd rice.
