#  Beans Carrot Thoran

Hi Friends!

Onam is one of the important festivals of Kerala and is celebrated in a grand way. According to popular legend, onam is celebrated to welcome King Mahabali, whose spirit is said to visit Kerala during Onam. The festival is a 10 day affair, starting on the Attam day and continuing to the last day Thiruvonam. The start of the festivities is marked by the floral designs laid on the floor in the front yard of houses. On the day of thiruvonam, huge and exquisite pookalams (floral designs) are laid out; people wear new clothes, go to temples and have a grand feast. This feast is called the onasadhya. The sadhya or feast would consist of 11 to 13 main dishes and people whether rich or poor, will make it a point to cook and have a grand feast atleast on this particular day. So that’s a wee bit of info regarding Onam.

Since Onam is fast approaching, we at home are getting ready for the Ona sadhya. A typical onasadhya would consist of Kalan, Olan, Aviyal, Thoran, Kootu Curry, Kichadi, Pulinji, Achar, Kaaya Upperi, Papadam, Pazham, Payasam, Paruppu, Sambar, Rasam, Curds and ofcourse Rice! Today I am posting a simple thoran.

Method

Wash string and finely chop beans. Wash, peel and finely chop carrots.

Heat a Kadai with oil, add mustard seeds once it crackles add the urad dal. Stir, once dal changes color, add the chopped beans and carrots. Stir well. Now add the turmeric powder and salt mix well. Sprinkle a little water and cook covered on medium flame till done. Keep stirring and checking once in a while so that the vegetables don’t burn. Add more water if required.

In the meanwhile, pulse the scraped coconut, green chillies and curry leaves just for few seconds or till the chillies and curry leaves are ground properly. Do not add water.

Once the vegetables are cooked, check if any water or moisture is remaining, if so, cook uncovered till the moisture evaporates then add the ground coconut, stir well.
