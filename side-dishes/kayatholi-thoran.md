#  Kayatholi Thoran / Plantain Peel Stir Fry




Nendrankai Chips, Sharkarapuratti, Koorkai, Pappadam ….Even the thought of these Kerala specialties brings back fond memories of my late grandfather. I have already mentioned this in one of my earlier posts, but still, while I am writing this post, I am once again reminded of him. He was a person of great courage, determination and will power. He also loved his food. He himself was a great cook and trained my grandmother to cook according to his likings. My grandmother would dutifully prepare all his favorites and serve it to him hot and fresh with lots of love.

Every year my grandfather visits Puthucode our Native place in Kerala during Navarathri and on his return he would bring with him all his Kerala favorites which were not so easily available in Chennai in those days. These would include Nendran Kai Chips, Sharakarapuratti, Pappadam, Koorkai, Chembu. He would not leave the Nendran Kai thol or Peel as well. And with the peel would be prepared this yummy thoran.

It’s been ages since I had this thoran. Last month, when my in-laws, returned from their trip to Sabari Mala, they got a bag of these plantain peels. I was so glad to see it and prepared the thoran immediately. It was a yummy and nostalgic treat.

Also I realized that we need not go to Kerala for getting the peels, just check with your neighbourhood chips store that fry and sell hot and fresh chips. They will gladly part with the peel which just finds its way into the bins.
