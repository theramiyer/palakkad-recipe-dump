#  Beetroot Thoran


A typical lunch menu in our house would consist of a Sambar and a thoran or mezhukuperatti, or Molaguttal and some tangy pachadi with rice, followed by rice and buttermilk or curds.

 Thorans are dry curries perfect with Sambar, Rasam or Mor Kootan. They can be prepared with different vegetables like, Beans, Yard Long Beans, Cabbage, Tender Jackfruit, Raw Papaya etc. They can also be prepared using a combination of veggies like, Cabbage, Carrot and green peas, or Beans and Carrot, Beet and carrot, amaranth leaves etc. These are spiced with a coarse paste of fresh coconut, green chillies and cumin seeds, garnished with fresh aromatic curry leaves. They are generally tempered in just about a tsp or two of coconut oil but any other oil would be just fine.

A variation to the regular thorans is to add cooked dals like Moong dal or tuar dal. Today’s recipe is one such. The dal has to be cooked just right, it should not get mushy.
