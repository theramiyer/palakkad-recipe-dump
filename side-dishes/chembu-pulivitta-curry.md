#  Chembu Pulivitta Curry (Spicy Tangy Colocasia Stir Fry)

Chembu Colocasia or taro root is one of my favorite vegetables. I love anything made out of it like Chembu Sambar, Chembu Moru Kootan, Chembu roast etc. Chembu Pulivitta curry is a perfect combination with Molagootal, molagutiam or curd rice. This is another traditional palakkad recipe.


Ingredients                                                         Serves - 4

1.       Chembu/colocasia/taro root/arvi – ½ kg
2.       Tamarind – gooseberry size
3.       Jaggery a little
4.       Turmeric Powder a pinch
5.       Asfoetida – a pinch
6.       Salt to taste

Dry roast and grind

1.       Channa Dal – 1 tbsp
2.       Dhaniya – 1.5 tbsp
3.       Red Chillies – 2 to 3 adjust according to taste

For seasoning

1.       Mustard Seeds – 1 tsp

Method

Steam the chembu with the skin. Do not overcook.Cool, remove skin, cut them into 1 inch thick pieces and keep aside.
 Soak tamarind in hot water for 10 mins. Squeeze, take a thick extract and keep it aside.
Dry roast channa dal, coriander seeds and red chillies. Cool and grind to a fine powder.
In a Kadai, heat oil, temper it with mustard seeds, once they splutter, add the curry leaves. Then add the chembu, turmeric, asfoetida and salt to taste. Fry for about 7 to 8 minutes. Then add the tamarind extract and little jaggery. Fry this for a few mins or till the tamarind extract is absorbed completely. Take care while stirring, not to mash the vegetable. 
Now add the spice powder and mix well. Let it fry for another 4 to 5 mins. Chembu Pulivtta curry is ready. Serve it as an accompaniment with steaming hot rice and molagootal.
