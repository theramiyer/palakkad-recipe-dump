#  Kathrikkai Podi Curry



Here is yet another recipe that serves as a great side dish for Molagootal. From this, my love for Molagootal is so evident.

After coming to Amsterdam, cooking Palakkad food, has been restricted to weekends and Molagootal finds its way on the menu on a one of the days, for sure. Back in India, Molagootal would be on the menu 3 times in a week. I know, now you must be wondering if this is a post on Molagootal, I am coming to that. Since Molagootal is a mild lentil and vegetable based stew, it is usually paired with something spicy and tangy, like Pachadi, Thogayl, etc.

This Kathrikkai podi curry is also one such side, that goes beautifully with Molagootal. And I make is very often as brinjal is my younger one’s favourite vegetable. You can pair this up even with rotis, but make sure you have dal alongside as this is a dry dish.



What you’ll need

    Small Purple Brinjal – 6 to 7
    Tamarind – marble sized ball
    Jaggery – ½ tsp (optional)
    Turmeric Powder – ¼ tsp
    Asafoetida – a generous pinch
    Salt to taste
    Curry Leaves – few Sprigs


To Roast and Grind

    Channa Dal/Kadala Paruppu – 1 tbsp
    Coriander Seeds – 1 tbsp
    Dry Red Chilly – 1 or 2 (Adjust according to taste)


To Temper

    Oil – 1 tbsp
    Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp


Method

    Soak the tamarind in very little hot water for 10 mins. Take a thick extract and keep aside.
    Heat a Kadai, and dry roast all the ingredients mentioned under “To Roast and Grind”. Always, add Channa dal first, when its half done, then add the coriander seeds and red chillies. This will prevent burning of coriander seeds.
    Cool and grind to a powder.
    Wash and slice the brinjals lengthwise. The pieces should be medium sized not too thick not too thin.
    Heat a Kadai with oil and temper with mustard seeds, once it splutters add the asafoetida and curry leaves.
    Then add the sliced brinjals, turmeric powder, and salt to taste.
    Stir well, cover and cook on medium flame for 7 to 8 minutes. Stir once in a while for even cooking. Do not add any water while cooking, else brinjals will turn mushy.
    Once the brinjal is cooked, roast for another 5 minutes in open kadai, so that the brinjal pieces are roasted well. Take care not to burn the pieces.
    Now add the thick tamarind extract, and jaggery. Mix carefully without mashing the pieces.
    Cook uncovered for 3 to 4 minutes or until the tamarind extract has become dry.
    Now add the prepared spice powder and mix carefully.
    Cook for another minute and remove from flame.




Serve along with rice, Molagootal or with roti and dal.

Note:

    Do not add water while cooking the brinjals.
    While stirring the curry, do it carefully so as not to mash the pieces as brinjal pieces will be delicate once cooked.
    Adding tamarind gives a nice tang, and personally recommend it. But if you want to serve it as a side for Sambar, then you may omit the tamarind.
