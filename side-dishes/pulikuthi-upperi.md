#  Pulikuthi Upperi


A tangy blend of stir fried country vegetables best describes Pulikuthi upperi. Yet another palakkad special. This yummy curry serves as a great side dish with the mild molagootal. The upperi also goes well with rasam. It is usually prepared with a variety of country vegetables like Raw bananas, Brinjal, Okra, Pumpkin, and Colocassia leaves (Arbi Leaves). It can be made with a combination of any of these vegetables or can be made with only raw bananas.

I have updated the recipe with an alternate method, which I feel comfortable with. Though traditionally, all the veggies are cooked in the tamarind water until done, I find the end result to be very mushy which is not the way I like it, though my grandmother makes the perfect upperi with this method itself. But just for my convenience I have started using the the second method which is a good alternate method, if you don't like your upperi mushy and soggy. So let’s get on with the recipe:



Ingredients                  (Serves: 3-)

    Raw Bananas – 2, medium sized
    Yellow Pumpkin – 200 gms
    Brinjals – 3 – 4
    Lady’s finger – 10
    Tamarind – A gooeseberry sized ball
    Asfoetida a pinch
    Turmeric Powder – a pinch
    Jaggery – a little
    Salt to taste


To grind

     Raw rice – 3 tbsps
    Fenugreek/methi seeds – ½ tsp
    Dried Red Chillies – 3 -4


For Seasoning

    Mustard Seeds – 1 tsp
    Curry Leaves – a few
    Coconut Oil – 1 tbsp


Method- 1

    Cut all the vegetables lengthwise into about 1 ½ inch pieces. 
    Soak tamarind in hot water for about 10 mins. Extract thick tamarind extract.
    In a vessel, add the vegetables and the tamarind extract. Add a pinch of turmeric powder, asafoetida, salt to taste and a bit of jaggery. Cover the vessel and cook till vegetables are done. Once the vegetables are cooked and if some water remains then cook without cover till the water evaporates.
    In the meanwhile, dry roast the ingredients mentioned under the to grind section. While roasting first add rice, once it starts changing color then add methi seeds and chillies as these will roast very quickly and if add in the beginning itself will get burnt. Cool and grind to a fine powder.
    Heat a non stick kadai with about 1 tbsp of coconut oil, add mustard seed. Once the seeds splutter, add curry leaves and then add the vegetables cooked in tamarind extract. Let it roast for some time stirring in between. After the vegetables are roasted well, add the curry powder. Mix it well. Take care not to mash the vegetables while stirring.

Delicious Pulikuthi Upperi is ready!

Method 2

    Heat a non stick kadai with oil, splutter mustard seeds, curry leaves and asafoetida.
    Add the raw banana pieces and turmeric powder. lower the heat to medium and cook covered till the raw banana pieces are 3/4 cooked. Keep stirring in between and sprinkle some water if required.
    Now add the brinjal, lady's finger and pumpkin pieces. add salt to taste and mix well.
    Cook covered for 4 to 5 minutes or until all the veggies are cooked.
    In the meanwhile, extract a thick tamarind juice with about 1/2 cup of water add this tamarind extract to the cooked veggies, add the jaggery now if using and cook uncovered on medium heat stirring occasionally until all the moisture has evaporated.
    Now add the roasted and ground powder mix well and remove from heat. You can cook for 3 to 5 minutes on low heat after adding the powder if you like.


Note: 

    Add Raw Bananas first let these be half done then add brinjals, lady’s finger and Pumpkin as these take lesser time to cook.
    Adjust the amount of tamarind depending on the quantity of vegetables used.
