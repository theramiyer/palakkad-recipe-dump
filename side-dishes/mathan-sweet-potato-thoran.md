#  Pumpkin - Sweet Potato Thoran/ Stir Fry


Today, my niece was clearing her book shelf to make way for her new set of school books. While clearing I happened to see a copy of Tinkle. On spotting it I was very excited. I immediately grabbed the book and read it then and there.

Tinkle, Champak and Amar Chitra Katha are comics I grew up with. Every time we made a journey by train, my father would get a copy of Tinkle from the book stall in the railway station. All through the long journey (from Jabalpur to Chennai) my brother and I would munch on the goodies that mom would’ve packed and read the books. I vividly remember the characters in it. Who can forget Shikari Shambu, Tantri the Mantri, Kalia the Crow and the Silly but hilarious Suppandi. I used to love solving the Tinkle Quiz.

Over the years, many changes have come over the book, but the overall element of learning the fun way is still intact. It felt great to read it after a gap of more than 20 years. I would love to know your favourite childhood comics.

Today’s recipe is one such, which I am made and had after a very long time. I love the combo of pumpkin, sweet potato and broad beans. Unfortunately, I did not have stock of broad beans and decided to prepare the thoran with the remaining two veggies. The slight sweet from the veggies and the heat from the chillies with hint of curry leaves and coconut makes this stir fry really yummy.
