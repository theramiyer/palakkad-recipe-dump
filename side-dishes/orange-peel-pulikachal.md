#  Orange Peel Pulikachal




Pulikachal is one of hubby’s favourite. My MIL makes excellent pulikachal. The trick to making a good pulikachal is achieving the right balance of spice, tang and sweetness. Now for those of you who are wondering what is pulikachal – it is a saucy preparation made out of tamarind extract and spices. It is generally mixed with plain hot white rice with a dollop of ghee or sesame oil. The taste is just amazing. It can also be served as an accompaniment to molagootal, curd rice, idly or dosa.

Few days back when I was visiting my grandmom, she prepared all my favourite dishes. She also prepared some new recipes which I was having for the first time. She continues to amaze me with her passion for cooking. Even at this age of 81 she is up to date with the latest current affairs. She watches cookery shows on t.v and even tries out some of them.

The orange peel pulikachal is the result of one such experiment of hers. Though I had heard a lot about this variant of pulikachal, I never tried it. When I had it there I just fell in love with its taste and the flavour of the orange peel. So off we go the recipe. 



What you’ll need

    Tamarind – A Lemon sized ball
    Orange Peel – of 1 orange
    Green Chilly – 1
    Jaggery – 1 tbsp
    Turmeric Powder – ¼ tsp
    Salt to taste


For tempering

    Oil – 1 tbsp
    Mustard Seeds – ½ tsp
    Curry Leaves - few


Dry Roast and Grind

    Channa Dal – 2 tsp
    Dried Red Chilly – 2 or 3 (adjust according to taste)
    Asafoetida – A big pinch
    Seasame Seeds – 1 tsp


Method

    Soak tamarind in 1 cup of hot water for 10 to 15 minutes. Squeeze and extract the tamarind juice.
    Heat a Kadai, dry roast, channa dal, dried red chilly and asafoetida till the dal turns golden brown. Cool completely and powder.
    Roast sesame seeds separately until they start popping. Cool and powder separately.
    Heat the same Kadai with oil. Temper with mustard seeds. Add curry leaves and chopped green chillies. Fry for a minute.
    Next add finely chopped orange peel and fry for a few minutes.
    Now add the tamarind extract to the kadai.
    Add turmeric powder, salt and jaggery. Let this boil for 10 minutes on medium flame.
    After a while of boiling, the tamarind extract will become a little thicker in consistency. At this stage add the roasted and powdered spices and mix well. Adjust seasoning and remove from heat.
    Finally add the powdered sesame powder.
