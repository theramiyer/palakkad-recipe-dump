#  Karamani and Uralaikizhangu Mezhukuperatti/Yard Long Beans and Potato Stir Fry




Today’s post is a very simple stir fry that is perfect with steamed rice and Rasam. It is ideal for the lazy afternoons when you are not in the mood to cook elaborate meals. It requires no grinding, roasting etc. And the chopping is also very easy since you need to cut them into long pieces.

This mezhukuperatti has become my lil’ one’s favorite and she prefers to pick and eat the beans rather than the potatoes. The usual combination with these beans is Raw Bananas and yam. But I'm so bored of having that combination and decided to try with potatoes. Being the most versatile vegetable, potatoes paired really well with the tender yard long beans.



What you’ll need

    Yard Long Beans – 4 cups (cut into 1 inch long pieces)
    Potato – 1. 5 cups (cut into fingers)
    Turmeric Powder – ¼ tsp
    Black Pepper Powder – ¼ tsp
    Salt to taste
    Coconut Oil – 1 tbsp




Method

    Heat a Kadai  with oil.
    Add the chopped beans and potatoes.
    Add salt and turmeric powder.
    Add about ¼ cup of water. Cover and cook in medium flame.
    Uncover and check after 5 minutes. Stir well.
    Cook covered till the beans and potatoes are done.
    Uncover add the pepper powder and let it fry for another 5 minutes on low flame. Take care not to burn it.

Serve with steamed rice and Rasam/Sambar/Mor Kootan.


Note: 

    Make sure to use tender beans.
    You can prepare this using only the yard long beans too.
    You may also use French beans instead of yard long beans.
