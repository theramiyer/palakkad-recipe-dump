#  Idichakka Thoran

Jackfruit is a seasonal fruit available from Mid March to May. In the beginning of the season you get the really small jackfruits or tender jackfruits called iddichakka in Malayalam. As days progress the jackfruit grows in size; you start getting the huge chakkas, which have beautiful golden yellow bulbs inside them. Jackfruit trees are a common sight in the backyards of Kerala homes. Come, Jackfruit season (summer), and the menu would be anything from iddichakka thoran, Chakka Chips, Chakka Curry, to Elai adai or Chakka Pradaman. Jackfruit jam or Chakka varrati is another delicacy. This way, it would be preserved for the whole year and Chakka Pradhaman or Elai Adai can be prepared at any time of the year.

Cutting the jackfruit is a really time consuming and tedious task, but the results are very sweet. Oil your palms and the knife with coconut oil since sticky gum oozes out of the fruit when you cut it open. Usually the Jackfruit is cut into a half and those into further halves. For the tender Jackfruit, only the prickly thick outer skin needs to be removed and the rest can be cut into pieces just like any other fruit or vegetable. For the ripe ones, the yellow bulbs have to be separated and the seeds have to be removed.

Idichakka Thoran is made out of fresh tender jackfruits, mildly spiced and flavored with fresh coconut. Thoran refers to any kind of dry curry. Here I am sharing the traditional Palakkad recipe. Though I’ve seen many of my Malayalee friends would add some onions and garlic too but we at home make it this way sans onions and garlic.



Ingredients

1. Small tender Jackfruit or Idichakka – 1
2. Fresh Grated Coconut – ½ cup
3. Green Chillies – 2
4. Turmeric Powder – a pinch
5. Salt to Taste

For seasoning

1. Coconut oil – 1 tblsp
2. Mustard Seeds – 1 tsp
3. Urad Dal – 1 tsp
4. Dried Red Chillies – 1 or 2
5. A few curry leaves

Method

Spread a newspaper on the counter, Oil your palms and the knife with coconut oil. Cut the jackfruit into half and then again into further halves, until they are of manageable size. Then remove the thick out skin and cut into pieces.
Cook these pieces with turmeric powder and little water for about 2 whistles in a pressure cooker.



Once cool, remove and pound the pieces with a pestle or use the back of a wooden spoon or a masher to get some shredded jackfruit. You could blend it in the processor too, but make sure the jackfruit pieces don’t become a paste. Grind the grated coconut and green chillies without adding any water. Keep aside.



Now, heat a Kadai with coconut oil, add the mustard seeds, once they splutter, add the urad dal and red chillies and curry leaves. Once, the dal changes color, add the shredded jackfruit pieces and sauté. Add salt to taste and fry for few minutes in medium flame. Then add the ground coconut and green chillies. Mix well. Finally drizzle about 2 tsps of coconut oil over the thoran.

Relish this yummy thoran with steaming hot rice and Moru Kootan or Sambar.
